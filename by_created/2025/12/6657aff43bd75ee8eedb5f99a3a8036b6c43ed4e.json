You can search for occurrences of, say, <a href=\"https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/curl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><code>library(curl)</code></a> using the URL <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=library(curl)&amp;type=code\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/search?q=library(curl)&amp;type=code</a>.</p>\n<p>R-universe displays this information on each package’s page as a badge counting “scripts” using a package – the number of hits for the aforementioned GitHub advanced search query.

Someone starring your repository, granted the account is <a href=\"https://the-guild.dev/blog/judging-open-source-by-github-stars\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">not a bot</a>, means someone “saw” your work which might already be valuable to you.</p>\n<p>As you might note on <a href=\"https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/curl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">curl’s page</a>, R-universe also displays a badge showing the number of GitHub stars.</p>\n<h2>\nSurveys\n</h2><p>If you have a good idea of what the potential userbase of your package is, or a way to reach a good proportion of current users, maybe you could run a survey to ask about packages and functions most used, and features most dearly missed?</p>\n<p>Someone mentioned this idea at the uRos (<a href=\"https://r-project.ro/conference2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Use of R in Official Statistics</a>) 2025 conference in their talk.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/12/11/package-usage/#fn:1\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></sup> For me, as an outsider to that community, it seemed like a perfect idea: National Institutes of Statistics have similar use cases for software and… they know how to run surveys!</p>\n<h2>\nContributions to the repository\n</h2><p>Or, the metric we could call <em>engagement</em> in influencers’ parlance. 😇</p>\n<p>If you develop your package in the open, users might contribute to it. The mere opening of an issue by an external person means they found and used your package! Furthermore, users themselves might tell you what doesn’t work, what’s missing, what they like about your package… and of course help you maintain the package. All the more reasons to <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/commcalls/apr2021-pkg-community/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">foster a community around your package</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on the same idea, if you wonder whether a function is used, you could try removing it or starting to remove it using proper <a href=\"https://devguide.ropensci.org/maintenance_evolution.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">deprecation</a> and seeing if anyone complains. Likewise, and more dramatically, you might hear from users if your package gets archived on CRAN for instance. 😅</p>\n<p>At the organization level, you can use our new experimental <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/09/11/repometrics-call-help/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dashboard</a> to get a bird eye view of repository activity.</p>\n<h2>\nUse cases reports\n</h2><p>At rOpenSci we collect <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/usecases\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">use cases of packages</a>. You could have a ticket dedicated to receiving <a href=\"https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda/issues/461\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">users testimonials, like in the quanteda repository</a>. The documentation of your package could point to the place where you would like to hear from users, be it to help you plan future developments, or to keep your motivation up!</p>\n<p>The benefit is gathering examples of authentic usage, and also getting the <a href=\"https://rstats.me/@adamhsparks/115619962041997060\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">motivation boost</a> from knowing someone uses your tool.</p>\n<h2>\nTelemetry\n</h2><p>Actually measuring usage at the source is very rare in R packages, but something that for instance the duckplyr maintainers have tried to implement, to inform <a href=\"https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/telemetry.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">development priorities</a>. This behavior can be controlled and turned off by users. Informing users of the telemetry is crucial.</p>\n<p>We can also wonder about the data collected by Copilot and friends, that you as a package maintainer have no access to: most common questions about your package, code reviewed or suggested by LLMs, etc. One can wonder whether such data might be helpful to software maintainers?</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion\n</h2><p>In this post, we gave a quick overview of some means to evaluate usage of your package, including many metrics already featured on the R-universe pages of packages. There is unfortunately no silver bullet, but definitely more to it than counting downloads.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>But I unfortunately do not remember who. 😭 If that’s you please tell me and I’ll update the post! <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/12/11/package-usage/#fnref:1\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-backlink\" target=\"_blank\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/12/11/package-usage/\"> rOpenSci - open tools for open science</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr/>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\n\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\n</div> </div>\n</article>",

Someone starring your repository, granted the account is\nnot a bot\n, means someone “saw” your work which might already be valuable to you.\nAs you might note on\ncurl’s page\n, R-universe also displays a badge showing the number of GitHub stars.\nSurveys\nIf you have a good idea of what the potential userbase of your package is, or a way to reach a good proportion of current users, maybe you could run a survey to ask about packages and functions most used, and features most dearly missed?\nSomeone mentioned this idea at the uRos (\nUse of R in Official Statistics\n) 2025 conference in their talk.\n1\nFor me, as an outsider to that community, it seemed like a perfect idea: National Institutes of Statistics have similar use cases for software and… they know how to run surveys!\nContributions to the repository\nOr, the metric we could call\nengagement\nin influencers’ parlance. 😇\nIf you develop your package in the open, users might contribute to it. The mere opening of an issue by an external person means they found and used your package! Furthermore, users themselves might tell you what doesn’t work, what’s missing, what they like about your package… and of course help you maintain the package. All the more reasons to\nfoster a community around your package\n.\nBased on the same idea, if you wonder whether a function is used, you could try removing it or starting to remove it using proper\ndeprecation\nand seeing if anyone complains. Likewise, and more dramatically, you might hear from users if your package gets archived on CRAN for instance. 😅\nAt the organization level, you can use our new experimental\ndashboard\nto get a bird eye view of repository activity.\nUse cases reports\nAt rOpenSci we collect\nuse cases of packages\n. You could have a ticket dedicated to receiving\nusers testimonials, like in the quanteda repository\n. The documentation of your package could point to the place where you would like to hear from users, be it to help you plan future developments, or to keep your motivation up!\nThe benefit is gathering examples of authentic usage, and also getting the\nmotivation boost\nfrom knowing someone uses your tool.\nTelemetry\nActually measuring usage at the source is very rare in R packages, but something that for instance the duckplyr maintainers have tried to implement, to inform\ndevelopment priorities\n. This behavior can be controlled and turned off by users. Informing users of the telemetry is crucial.\nWe can also wonder about the data collected by Copilot and friends, that you as a package maintainer have no access to: most common questions about your package, code reviewed or suggested by LLMs, etc. One can wonder whether such data might be helpful to software maintainers?\nConclusion\nIn this post, we gave a quick overview of some means to evaluate usage of your package, including many metrics already featured on the R-universe pages of packages. There is unfortunately no silver bullet, but definitely more to it than counting downloads.\nBut I unfortunately do not remember who. 😭 If that’s you please tell me and I’ll update the post!\n↩︎\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
