See the <a href=\"https://freerangestats.info/blog/2025/11/30/pacific-population\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">first post in the series</a> for more background. Today I’m looking at two charts relating to net migration and its role in Pacific islands’ population growth. These were used early in the presentation that these blog posts refer to, as part of building the story of the importance of people movements in understanding the Pacific.</p>\n<p>These two plots are pretty straightforward. The data comes from the UN’s 2024 population prospects, a data source I’ve used in several blog posts before. The particular dataset we want is the “standard indicators”—these include net migration, natural change (ie births minus deaths), and total population for each year from 1950 to 2050; which is what we’re looking for for the charts today.</p>\n<p>First downloading and wrangling the data. Pretty simple:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre># draws charts of migration and natural change impact on growth\n# The source for this is UN population projections.

A few secondary things to note: another reason to use dashes and dots in addition to the red and green contrast is because of the relatively high frequency of red-green colourblind people; and I also carefully make sure the legend shows the natural increase, total population, net migration in the same vertical sequence as they appear in the plots.\nHere’s the code for this simple chart:\nselected <- c(\"Niue\", \"Marshall Islands\", \"Samoa\", \"Kiribati\", \"Northern Mariana Islands\", \"Papua New Guinea\")\n\npict_indicators |> \n  filter(country %in% selected) |> \n  select(country, Year, `Net migration gain/loss` = nnm, `Natural increase` = nc, `Total increase` = pc) |> \n  gather(variable, value, -Year, -country) |> \n  mutate(variable = fct_relevel(variable, \"Net migration gain/loss\", after = Inf)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = value, colour = variable, linetype = variable)) +\n  facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 3, scales = \"free_y\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"darkgreen\", \"blue\", \"red\")) +\n  scale_linetype_manual(values = c(2,1,3)) +\n  labs(y = \"Annual change in population (thousands)\",\n       x = \"\",\n       colour = \"\", linetype = \"\")\nThat’s all for now! Coming up in subsequent posts—diaspora, the world’s largest Pacific cities, and remittances.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nfree range statistics - R\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
