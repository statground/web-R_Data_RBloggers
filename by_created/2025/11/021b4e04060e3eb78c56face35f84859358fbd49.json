I’ve asked the same damn question at least 4-5 times. Only I didn’t really understand it was the same question. That’s one of the problems of not really being good at something; it’s hard to think abstractly about it. I’m not really good at R, so sometimes I don’t realize that multiple concepts are related. As I talk with other new users of R it’s clear that unless they come from a programming language with an apply-esque construct they likely are struggling with R. I think most of the confusion comes from a) not understanding what data format apply() is going to return and b) not understanding anonymous functions.</p>\n<p>With this in mind I did a little screencast illustrating how this struggle plays out for a new users.
