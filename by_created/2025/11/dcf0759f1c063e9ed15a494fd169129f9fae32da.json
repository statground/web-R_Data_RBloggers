Its not widely used in the R community yet, but I expect it will be soon. You can create your entire R project, interpret the results and write a draft of your findings without writing any R code.</p>\n<p>Most of these tools are not available (as of writing) in RStudio, or have only limited functionality. So you need to use a different IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to run your R code. Here I’ll explain how to set-up VSCode (a popular IDE) so you can use Cline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"software-requirements\">Software requirements</h2>\n<p>To set up VScode for R and Cline, you’ll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R programming language</li>\n<li>VScode text editor</li>\n<li>R extension for VScode</li>\n<li>Cline AI assistant extension for VScode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that if you computer is controlled centrally by an IT department, you may need to request admin access to install software, or email IT and ask for them to come and help you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"install-r\">Install R</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the official R project website: https://www.r-project.org/</li>\n<li>Click the “download R” link in the Getting Started section</li>\n<li>Choose a CRAN mirror close to your location</li>\n<li>Download the appropriate R installer for your operating system</li>\n<li>Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete installation</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"r-packages\">R packages</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Open R or RStudio</li>\n<li>Install language server <code>install.packages(\"languageserver\")</code></li>\n<li>Install httpgd <code>install.packages(\"httpgd\")</code> (this helps improve plots in VScode).
