Indeed, the aim of an experiment like this one is not only to compare the treatments with the control, but it is also to analyse the factorial structure, to assess the existence of possible interaction effects among the predictors. Therefore, it may be worth to take a minute to develop a more efficient model to describe our experimental data.\nWith R, it will be convenient to create a new ‘dummy’ variable to part the controls and the factorial structure, as shown in the box below. In this case, we have two controls, but, in other case, this dummy variable will be binary.\ndataset$CvT <- with(dataset, factor(ifelse(Herbicide == \"HandWeeded\", \"chk1\",\n                      ifelse(Herbicide == \"Unweeded\", \"chk2\",\"trt\"))))\nNow, we code the model, by nesting the factorial structure within the newly created variable.\nmodel2 <- lm(Yield ~ CvT/(Herbicide*DoseF*Adjuvant), data = dataset)\nanova(model2)\n## Analysis of Variance Table\n## \n## Response: Yield\n##                              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \n## CvT                           2 46.251 23.1253 26.2080 5.637e-09 ***\n## CvT:Herbicide                 1  3.701  3.7008  4.1941  0.044805 *  \n## CvT:DoseF                     1  0.106  0.1064  0.1206  0.729531    \n## CvT:Adjuvant                  3  6.546  2.1820  2.4729  0.069918 .  \n## CvT:Herbicide:DoseF           1  0.220  0.2197  0.2490  0.619534    \n## CvT:Herbicide:Adjuvant        3 11.345  3.7815  4.2856  0.008193 ** \n## CvT:DoseF:Adjuvant            3  2.211  0.7372  0.8354  0.479544    \n## CvT:Herbicide:DoseF:Adjuvant  3  2.225  0.7415  0.8404  0.476920    \n## Residuals                    62 54.707  0.8824                      \n## ---\n## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\nThe ‘CvT’ effects represents the contrast between the two controls and the treated plots and it has three levels (untreated, hand-weeded and treated). We see that this effect is significant, as well as the ‘Herbicide:Adjuvant’ interaction within treated plots. On the other hand, the ‘Dose’ effect within treated plots, is not significant. We can use the\nemmeans()\nfunction to extract the relevant marginal means and compare them.\ncld(emmeans(model2, ~CvT), Letters = LETTERS)\n##  CvT  emmean    SE df lower.CL upper.CL .group\n##  chk2   11.6 0.332 62     11.0     12.3  A    \n##  trt    13.9 0.117 62     13.6     14.1   B   \n##  chk1   14.8 0.332 62     14.1     15.5    C  \n## \n## Results are averaged over the levels of: Adjuvant, DoseF, Herbicide \n## Confidence level used: 0.95 \n## P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 3 estimates \n## significance level used: alpha = 0.05 \n## NOTE: If two or more means share the same grouping symbol,\n##       then we cannot show them to be different.\n##       But we also did not show them to be the same.\ncld(emmeans(model2, ~CvT:Herbicide:Adjuvant), Letters = LETTERS)\n##  Herbicide   Adjuvant   CvT  emmean    SE df lower.CL upper.CL .group\n##  Unweeded    None       chk2   11.6 0.332 62     11.0     12.3  A    \n##  Rimsulfuron None       trt    13.0 0.332 62     12.3     13.6  AB   \n##  Dicamba     Frigate    trt    13.3 0.332 62     12.6     13.9   BC  \n##  Dicamba     Surfactant trt    13.5 0.332 62     12.8     14.2   BCD \n##  Dicamba     None       trt    13.7 0.332 62     13.1     14.4   BCD \n##  Dicamba     MineralOil trt    14.1 0.332 62     13.4     14.8   BCD \n##  Rimsulfuron MineralOil trt    14.3 0.332 62     13.6     15.0   BCD \n##  Rimsulfuron Surfactant trt    14.6 0.332 62     13.9     15.2    CD \n##  Rimsulfuron Frigate    trt    14.7 0.332 62     14.0     15.3    CD \n##  HandWeeded  None       chk1   14.8 0.332 62     14.1     15.5     D \n## \n## Results are averaged over the levels of: DoseF \n## Confidence level used: 0.95 \n## P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 10 estimates \n## significance level used: alpha = 0.05 \n## NOTE: If two or more means share the same grouping symbol,\n##       then we cannot show them to be different.\n##       But we also did not show them to be the same.\nI suggest that this type of analysis is simple enough and makes better use of the information contained in our dataset.\nThanks for reading and happy coding!\nAndrea Onofri\nDepartment of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Sciences\nUniversity of Perugia (Italy)\n[email protected]\nFollow\n@onofriandreapg\nReference\nPiepho, H.P., Edmondson, R.N., 2018.
