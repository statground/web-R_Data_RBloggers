Sanderson II, MPH\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nSteve's Data Tips and Tricks\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nIntroduction\nThe multinomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the probability of obtaining a specific number of counts for k different outcomes, when each outcome has a fixed probability of occurring.\nIn R, we can use the\nrmultinom()\nfunction to simulate random samples from a multinomial distribution, and the\ndmultinom()\nfunction to calculate the probability of a specific outcome.\nExamples\nExample 1\nSuppose we have a fair die, and we want to simulate rolling the die 10 times. We can use the\nrmultinom()\nfunction to do this as follows:\n# Simulate rolling a fair die 10 times\ndie_rolls <- rmultinom(\n  n = 10, size = 1, \n  prob = c(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6)\n  )\n\n# Print the results\nprint(die_rolls)\n[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0\n[2,]    0    1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0\n[3,]    1    0    0    0    0    0    0    1    0     0\n[4,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0\n[5,]    0    0    0    0    0    1    1    0    1     0\n[6,]    0    0    1    1    1    0    0    0    0     1\nExample 2\nSuppose we want to calculate the probability of getting exactly two ones, two threes, two fours, two fives, and two sixes when rolling a fair die 10 times. We can use the\ndmultinom()\nfunction to do this as follows:\n# Calculate the probability of getting exactly two ones, two threes, two fours, two fives, and two sixes when rolling a fair die 10 times\nprobability <- dmultinom(\n  x = c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2), \n  size = 10, \n  prob = c(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6)\n  )\n\n# Print the result\nprint(probability)\n[1] 0.01161216\nTry it on your own!\nI encourage readers to try using the\nrmultinom()\nand\ndmultinom()\nfunctions on their own data. For example, you could simulate rolling a die 100 times and see how often each outcome occurs. Or, you could calculate the probability of getting a certain number of heads and tails when flipping a coin 10 times.\nHere is an example of how to use the\nrmultinom()\nfunction to simulate flipping a coin 10 times and calculate the probability of getting exactly five heads and five tails:\n# Simulate flipping a coin 10 times\ncoin_flips <- rmultinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))\n\n# Calculate the probability of getting exactly five heads and five tails\nprobability <- dmultinom(x = c(5, 5), size = 10, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(probability)\n[1] 0.2460938\nI hope this blog post has helped you learn how to use the multinomial distribution in R.
