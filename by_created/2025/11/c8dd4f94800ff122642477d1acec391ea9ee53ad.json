Using multidimensional scaling ordination and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we tested for differences in community structure between logged and not logged sites and across distance categories. Benthic communities differed significantly between logged and not logged sites (PERMANOVA p = 0.027), with logged sites showing 14.2% lower coral cover (48.0% vs 62.2%). Distance-dependent effects were highly significant (p = 0.002), explaining 11.9% of community variance. Sites within 1 km of logging showed severely degraded conditions (31.2% coral cover, 33.3% sand cover), while sites beyond 10 km maintained high coral cover (62.9%). Recovery followed a clear gradient: moderate distance sites (1-3 km) had 55.3% coral cover, far sites (3-10 km) had 60.4% coral cover. Categorical distance analysis proved more informative than continuous distance relationships, indicating threshold effects rather than linear gradients. These findings demonstrate that logging impacts extend further than previously documented, with measurable effects at sites 1-3 km from operations. Our results provide quantitative evidence for establishing buffer zones around coral reefs and highlight the need for watershed-scale conservation planning that integrates terrestrial forest management with marine protected area design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"abstract-from-replicate-2\">Abstract from replicate 2</h2>\n<p>Coral reef ecosystems face increasing threats from terrestrial activities, with logging-induced sedimentation representing a significant but understudied impact mechanism. This study examined benthic community structure across 49 coral reef sites in the Solomon Islands using multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination to test the hypothesis that logging activities influence reef community composition through sedimentation. We applied non-metric multidimensional scaling to benthic cover data using both Euclidean and Bray-Curtis distance metrics, with environmental vector fitting to identify ecological gradients. The analysis revealed strong community gradients primarily associated with coral branching cover (r² = 0.82) and soft coral cover (r² = 0.62), while water clarity showed moderate correlation (r² = 0.24) with community structure. Contrary to expectations, distance to logging showed weak correlation with community patterns (r² = 0.056, p = 0.101), suggesting that logging impacts operate through pathways not captured by simple proximity measures. The results demonstrate MDS ordination effectiveness for revealing coral community structure patterns while highlighting the complexity of logging-reef relationships in tropical marine systems.</p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"http://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2025/09/12/creating-a-first-draft-in-one-prompt.html\"> Bluecology blog</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr/>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\n\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\n</div> </div>\n</article>",
