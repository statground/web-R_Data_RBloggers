Note that the Hebrew word must not contain vowels, or else there will be no match.\nI also added a little exploration of five Biblical descendants of Abraham and the number 26.  26 has a lot of significance in the Bible.\n26 is the gematria value of the four letter unspeakable Hebrew name for G-d:  Yod + He + Vav + He =  10 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 26.\n26 is the number of generations from Adam to Moses.\n26 is the number of generations from David to Jesus according to one geneaology (but interpretations differ).\nThere are many examples of Biblical gematria values of 26.\n26 also has some interesting mathematical properties such as it is the sum of a cube’s 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices, but I will leave such mathematical properties for another time.\nFor five of the Biblical descendants of Abraham:\nGematria of Isaac יצחק is 208 is multiple of 26.\nGematria of Jacob יעקב is 182 is multiple of 26.\nGematria of Joseph יוסף is 156 is multiple of 26.\nGematria of Ishmael ישמעאל is 451 is not multiple of 26.\nGematria of Esau עשו is 376 is not multiple of 26.\nI will leave an interpretation of the above to the reader.\nThere are many other examples of the use of gematria to help explain the Bible.  Also, I have limited this to Standard Gematria; there are other forms.\nIs gematria clever wordplay and coincidence?  Or were the biblical writers trying to tell us something?\nThe R code is as follows:\n# Define Hebrew letters, names, and gematria numbers\ndf <- data.frame(\n  hebrew = c(\"\\u05D0\", \"\\u05D1\", \"\\u05D2\", \"\\u05D3\", \"\\u05D4\",\n             \"\\u05D5\", \"\\u05D6\", \"\\u05D7\", \"\\u05D8\", \"\\u05D9\",\n             \"\\u05DA\", \"\\u05DB\", \"\\u05DC\", \"\\u05DD\", \"\\u05DE\",\n             \"\\u05DF\", \"\\u05E0\", \"\\u05E1\", \"\\u05E2\", \"\\u05E3\",\n             \"\\u05E4\", \"\\u05E5\", \"\\u05E6\", \"\\u05E7\", \"\\u05E8\",\n             \"\\u05E9\", \"\\u05EA\"),\n  \n  name = c(\"Alef\", \"Bet\", \"Gimel\", \"Dalet\", \"He\", \"Vav\", \"Zayin\", \n           \"Chet\", \"Tet\", \"Yod\", \"Final_Kaf\", \"Kaf\", \"Lamed\", \"Final_Mem\", \n           \"Mem\", \"Final_Nun\", \"Nun\", \"Samech\", \"Ayin\", \"Final_Pe\", \"Pe\", \n           \"Final_Tsadi\", \"Tsadi\", \"Qof\", \"Resh\", \"Shin\", \"Tav\"),\n  \n  number = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 20, 30, 40, 40, \n             50, 50, 60, 70, 80, 80, 90, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400)\n)\n\n# Define words;  no vowels!\nyitzchak <- \"יצחק\"\nyaakov <- \"יעקב\"\nyosef <- \"יוסף\"\nishmael <- \"ישמעאל\"\nesau <- \"עשו\"\n\nwords <- c(yitzchak, yaakov, yosef, ishmael, esau)\n\ngematria <- function(word) {\n   # Split word into characters\n   v <- strsplit(word, split = \"\")[[1]]\n   # Calculate Gematria of word using vectorized lookup\n   gematria_value <- sum(df$number[match(v, df$hebrew)])\n   if (gematria_value %% 26 == 0) divisibility = \"is multiple of 26\" \n     else divisibility = \"is not multiple of 26\"\n  # Output result\n  cat(\"Gematria of\", word, \"is\", gematria_value, divisibility, \"\\n\")\n}\n\nfor (word in words) {\n  gematria(word)\n}\nEnd\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nOnline College Math Teacher\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
