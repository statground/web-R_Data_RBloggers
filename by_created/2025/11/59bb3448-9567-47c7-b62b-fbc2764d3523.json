She supports researchers in writing clear, efficient, and reproducible code, with a focus on practical, applied solutions. Her work includes teaching R, data analysis, and scientific coding to her fellow researchers.

In this workshop, you’ll learn practical strategies to find and fix performance issues and how to use packages that improve code speed and memory efficiency. The topics include:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">– Profiling and benchmarking to find slow code and compare alternatives with `profvis` and `microbenchmark`</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">– Best practices to avoid common bottlenecks</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">– Efficient data analysis using packages like `data.table`, `collapse`, and `arrow`</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">– Parallelization with packages from the `futureverse`</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">– C++ integration to boost performance further with `Rcpp`</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The session includes live demonstrations and code examples to follow during or after the workshop.
