One thing that I find often trips up students is the use of R’s accessors and mutators.

A simple example is taking a subset of a vector:</p>\n<p><code>\n\r\nletters[1:3]\n\r\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\r\n</code></p>\n<p>As you can see, the result is a <em>character vector</em> containing the first three letters of letters vector.</p>\n<p>Good programming languages have a standard pattern for accessor and mutators.

R natively provides vectors, lists, data frames, matrices, etc.  In truth, one can get by using only <strong>[</strong> to extract information from these structures, but the others are handy in certain scenarios.  So much so that after a while, they feel indispensible.
