Turns out that, yes it does make sense! Because the multiverse will pick up the latest release automatically.\nSteffi only needs to remember to create a new release after improving weathercan.\nRead more about\nweathercan\n.\nWhat’s next for those packages?\nNow that these packages are in, they’re distributed through the\ncommunity\nrepository\n.\nIt’s like a preview of new releases.\nIn a few weeks, when R-multiverse starts building the next\nproduction\nsnapshot\n, they will be checked together with other packages.\nIf they are good to go, their release at that point will be the one built into production.\nIf there are some issues, the maintainer can still push fixes.\nAs long as those packages are listed in the R-multiverse, they will participate in the quarterly production snapshots.\nThe maintainers only need to keep creating releases (good practice anyway) and to follow the\nstatus\nof their package on the multiverse.\nFor the package users to know they can install the package from the\ncommunity\nor the\nproduction\nrepositories, package maintainers will need to update the installation instructions in the README of their package.\nThey could also add a\nbadge\n.\nWhat’s next for the R-multiverse?\nAfter the posit conf talk, the rOpenSci community call, and the rOpenSci coworking session, the R multiverse is aiming at increasing participation in its system to strengthen and diversify it.\nNew package submissions are welcome, as are\nquestions and feature requests\n.\nYou can also apply to become a\npackage moderator\nto help handle new submissions.\nAnd before that in a talk at posit::conf! Stay tuned for the release of the public talk recordings on YouTube.\n↩︎\nOr a slightly more involved JSON file if the package is in a subdirectory for instance.\n↩︎\nPackage authorship stays the same.\n↩︎\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
