I wouldn’t recommend relying on AI for your very first steps in R, but it can be a valuable tool when you’ve tried to accomplish something and remain stuck. Include the error message you’re encountering in your prompt, or ask AI to explain the code line by line if you’re unsure what it does. However, avoid asking AI to write entire programs or scripts for you, as this will limit your learning and you may be surprised by errors. Use AI to assist you, but always review its suggestions and retain final control over your code.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h2 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul class=\"conclusion-list\">\n<li>Learning R as a humanities major can be daunting, but persistence pays off.</li>\n<li>Embrace small, consistent wins — DataCamp’s bite‑sized exercises are perfect for that.</li>\n<li>Visualizations unlock understanding — seeing data come to life cements concepts.</li>\n<li>Phase in documentation and books when you need to tackle more advanced topics.</li>\n<li>Use AI to debug your code and explain what the code of other programmers does.</li>\n<li>Join the community — Stack Overflow, GitHub, online books and peer groups bridge gaps when videos aren’t enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h2 id=\"ready-to-start-your-own-journey\">Ready to Start Your Own Journey?</h2>\n<p>If you’re also beginning or if you want to deepen your R skills, DataCamp is a pleasant and productive way to get going.

Thesis & Beyond\nIn 2021, I completed my master’s degree with a thesis evaluating educational policies in Brazil. To perform this analysis, I used the synthetic control method—implemented via an\nR package\n. If you’re interested, you can read my thesis here:\nBetter Incentives, Better Marks: A Synthetic Control Evaluation of Educational Policies in Ceará, Brazil\n. \nMy thesis is also an example of how you can learn R by working on a project with goals and final results. It also introduced me to\nGit\nand\nGitHub\n, a well known system for controling the versions of your coding projects and a nice tool to showcase your coding skills.\n7. AI as a resource to learn programming\nAlthough AI wasn’t part of my initial learning journey, I shouldn’t overlook its growing influence on programming in recent years. I wouldn’t recommend relying on AI for your very first steps in R, but it can be a valuable tool when you’ve tried to accomplish something and remain stuck. Include the error message you’re encountering in your prompt, or ask AI to explain the code line by line if you’re unsure what it does. However, avoid asking AI to write entire programs or scripts for you, as this will limit your learning and you may be surprised by errors. Use AI to assist you, but always review its suggestions and retain final control over your code.\nKey Takeaways\nLearning R as a humanities major can be daunting, but persistence pays off.\nEmbrace small, consistent wins — DataCamp’s bite‑sized exercises are perfect for that.\nVisualizations unlock understanding — seeing data come to life cements concepts.\nPhase in documentation and books when you need to tackle more advanced topics.\nUse AI to debug your code and explain what the code of other programmers does.\nJoin the community — Stack Overflow, GitHub, online books and peer groups bridge gaps when videos aren’t enough.\nReady to Start Your Own Journey?\nIf you’re also beginning or if you want to deepen your R skills, DataCamp is a pleasant and productive way to get going.
