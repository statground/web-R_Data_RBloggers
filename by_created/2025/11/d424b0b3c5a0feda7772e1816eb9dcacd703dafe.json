This dataset, like mtcars and flights, are synthetic datasets that were used as data challenges (the other two are now basic datasets for reprexes as well). This dataset, however, shows the power of plotly. Code in R library(tidyverse) library(HistData) library(plotly) data(\"Pollen\") head(Pollen) # A tibble: 6 × 5 ridge nub crack weight density 1 -2.35 3.63 5.03 10.9 -1.39 2 -1.15 1.48 3.24 -0.594 2.12 3 -2.52 -6.86 -2.80 8.46 -3.41 4 5.75 -6.51 -5.15 4.35 -10.3 5 8.75 -3.90 -1.38 -14.9 -2.42 6 10.4 -3.16 12.8 -14.9 -6.49 The first three variables are meant to be plotted on the x, y and z axis, where the other variables are meant to describe the grains of pollen. Doing a quick correlation shows that there is at least one strong correlation that can be seen through the use of color, where weight is highly correlated with the x-axis. Code in R res add_markers(color = ~weight, size=2) |> layout(title=\"David Coleman's Synthetic Pollen Dataset\")|> config(displayModeBar=FALSE) Can you see it? Image below to recreate… Eureka!
