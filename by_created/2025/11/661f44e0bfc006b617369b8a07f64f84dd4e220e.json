Fuji X100V, Nicholas Tierney.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I’ve been trying to read a bit more widely about R programming and other features of programming lately. I’ve seen some great newsletters from people like Bob Rudis in his <a href=\"https://dailydrop.hrbrmstr.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">“Daily Drop” series</a>, and I think that has inspired me to collect my monthly reading notes into a blog post / digest / newsletter type thing.</p>\n<p>I guess to articulate more clearly, want to do it for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Help me share bulk links of interest to the Research Software Engineer, with a focus being on those who use R.</li>\n<li>Force me to read these links so I can provide a little summary of the content.</li>\n<li>Engage more broadly with the RSE rstats community.</li>\n<li>Somewhat catch up on the technology/rstats world since I hiked the <a href=\"https://njt.micro.blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pacific crest trail from May – October 2023</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My intention is for these to be short lists. But this one is already getting bigger. This might be something regular, or something irregular. Who knows, maybe it’s just a one off. Here we go.</p>\n<h1 id=\"blog--news-posts\">Blog / news posts</h1>\n<p>Some of these links are things I missed, and other ones are just things I thought were really good. They could be new, they could be a few years old!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tidydesign.substack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hadley Wickham’s Design Newsletter</a>. I’ve followed Hadley’s work quite closely since 2013, and I was a little alarmed to see I had somehow missed his starting a newsletter about: “designing and implementing quality R code”. I’d seen his book, <a href=\"https://design.tidyverse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">“tidy design principles”</a> a while back, but it’s super exciting that they are working on it again. I highly recommend the newsletter. It’s also nice to see people engaging with <code>#rstats</code> content in a place that isn’t social media.</p>\n<p>The rOpenSci newletter is worth subscribing to, one of my favourite sections is the <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/11/24/news-november-2023/#package-development-corner\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">package development corner</a>, which contains lots of useful links to other cool new R features, blog posts, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mm218.dev/posts/2023-11-07-classed-errors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Mahoney’s post on classed errors</a> really helped solidify my understanding and the overall benefits to not only the user, but the developer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2016/04/kings-day-speech.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">King’s Day Speech</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Guido van Rossum</a>, <strong>the creator of the python language</strong>. A nice essay / auto biography. I especially enjoyed this quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In reality, programming languages are how programmers express and communicate ideas — and the audience for those ideas is other programmers, not computers. The reason: the computer can take care of itself, but programmers are always working with other programmers, and poorly communicated ideas can cause expensive flops.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They say, “science isn’t science until it’s communicated”, and building on that, I think that good science requires good communication. It doesn’t matter if your idea is world changing, if no one can understand it.</p>\n<p>Bob Rudis’s <a href=\"https://dailydrop.hrbrmstr.dev/2024/01/01/drop-395-2024-01-01-happy-new-year/#\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">“Daily Driver” post</a> contains an amazing list of things he uses daily from hardware to OS, VPN, RSS readers, browsers, browser extensions, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2024/01/bye-rstudio/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">“Bye, RStudio/Posit!”</a> by Yihui Xie. He’s leaving Posit! It came as a surprise to me. I have a lot of positive feelings about his incredible contributions to R and my career and life, I can’t condense them all here. But I know that his work on knitr, rmarkdown, xaringan, blogdown, and bookdown have all had incredibly positive impacts on how I communicate my work, and I simply don’t think I’d have the career I’ve had without him. Thank you, Yihui.</p>\n<h1 id=\"r-packages\">R Packages</h1>\n<p>It’s hard to pick R packages to showcase, there are I think more than 20K on CRAN now. Rather than a laundry list of R packages I use, here are some of my favourite R packages that I use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tidyverse</a>, I’d be lost without it. It is simply an outstanding collection of software for doing data science and statistics in R.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">targets</a>, one of my favourite R packages. <a href=\"https://wlandau.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Will Landau</a>, the developer behind targets is I think perhaps the most responsive and kindest maintainer I’ve ever encountered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/milesmcbain/tflow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tflow</a> by <a href=\"https://milesmcbain.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Miles McBain</a>, an ergonomic package that goes alongside the targets package. Use along with Miles’s other package, <a href=\"https://github.com/milesmcbain/fnmate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">fnmate</a>. I think these tips are really useful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Put all your target code in separate functions in <code>R/</code>. Use <code>fnmate</code> to quickly generate function definitions in the right place. Let the plan in <code>_targets.R</code> define the structure of the workflow and use it as a map for your sources.

Fuji X100V, Nicholas Tierney.\nI’ve been trying to read a bit more widely about R programming and other features of programming lately. I’ve seen some great newsletters from people like Bob Rudis in his\n“Daily Drop” series\n, and I think that has inspired me to collect my monthly reading notes into a blog post / digest / newsletter type thing.\nI guess to articulate more clearly, want to do it for the following reasons:\nHelp me share bulk links of interest to the Research Software Engineer, with a focus being on those who use R.\nForce me to read these links so I can provide a little summary of the content.\nEngage more broadly with the RSE rstats community.\nSomewhat catch up on the technology/rstats world since I hiked the\npacific crest trail from May – October 2023\n.\nMy intention is for these to be short lists. But this one is already getting bigger. This might be something regular, or something irregular. Who knows, maybe it’s just a one off. Here we go.\nBlog / news posts\nSome of these links are things I missed, and other ones are just things I thought were really good. They could be new, they could be a few years old!\nHadley Wickham’s Design Newsletter\n. I’ve followed Hadley’s work quite closely since 2013, and I was a little alarmed to see I had somehow missed his starting a newsletter about: “designing and implementing quality R code”. I’d seen his book,\n“tidy design principles”\na while back, but it’s super exciting that they are working on it again. I highly recommend the newsletter. It’s also nice to see people engaging with\n#rstats\ncontent in a place that isn’t social media.\nThe rOpenSci newletter is worth subscribing to, one of my favourite sections is the\npackage development corner\n, which contains lots of useful links to other cool new R features, blog posts, and more.\nMike Mahoney’s post on classed errors\nreally helped solidify my understanding and the overall benefits to not only the user, but the developer.\nKing’s Day Speech\nby\nGuido van Rossum\n,\nthe creator of the python language\n. A nice essay / auto biography. I especially enjoyed this quote:\nIn reality, programming languages are how programmers express and communicate ideas — and the audience for those ideas is other programmers, not computers. The reason: the computer can take care of itself, but programmers are always working with other programmers, and poorly communicated ideas can cause expensive flops.\nThey say, “science isn’t science until it’s communicated”, and building on that, I think that good science requires good communication. It doesn’t matter if your idea is world changing, if no one can understand it.\nBob Rudis’s\n“Daily Driver” post\ncontains an amazing list of things he uses daily from hardware to OS, VPN, RSS readers, browsers, browser extensions, and more.\n“Bye, RStudio/Posit!”\nby Yihui Xie. He’s leaving Posit! It came as a surprise to me. I have a lot of positive feelings about his incredible contributions to R and my career and life, I can’t condense them all here. But I know that his work on knitr, rmarkdown, xaringan, blogdown, and bookdown have all had incredibly positive impacts on how I communicate my work, and I simply don’t think I’d have the career I’ve had without him. Thank you, Yihui.\nR Packages\nIt’s hard to pick R packages to showcase, there are I think more than 20K on CRAN now. Rather than a laundry list of R packages I use, here are some of my favourite R packages that I use.\ntidyverse\n, I’d be lost without it. It is simply an outstanding collection of software for doing data science and statistics in R.\ntargets\n, one of my favourite R packages.\nWill Landau\n, the developer behind targets is I think perhaps the most responsive and kindest maintainer I’ve ever encountered.\ntflow\nby\nMiles McBain\n, an ergonomic package that goes alongside the targets package. Use along with Miles’s other package,\nfnmate\n. I think these tips are really useful:\nPut all your target code in separate functions in\nR/\n. Use\nfnmate\nto quickly generate function definitions in the right place. Let the plan in\n_targets.R\ndefine the structure of the workflow and use it as a map for your sources. Use ‘jump to function’ to quickly navigate to them.\nUse a call\ntar_make()\nto kick off building your plan in a new R session.\nPut all your\nlibrary()\ncalls into\npackages.R\n. This way you’ll have them in one place when you go to add sandboxing with\nrenv\n,\npackarat\n, and\nswitchr\netc.\nTake advantage of automation for loading\ntargets\ntargets at the cursor with the ‘load target at cursor’ addin. Or the\ntflow\naddin: ‘load editor targets’ to load all targets referred to in the current editor.\nautotest\nby\nMark Padgham\nwith\nrOpenSci\n. This package does rigorous, automated testing of your R package. Useful to help really kick the tyres of your work.\nAnd not quite an R package, but something from within\nusethis\n/\nrlang\nas advertised by\nGarrick Aden Buie\n, when\ncommenting on\nmy blog post,\n“Code Smell: Error Handling Eclipse”\n:\nicymi and because it’s not widely publicized, there are type checking functions in {rlang} that you can copy into your package code with usethis::use_standalone()\nhttps://github.com/r-lib/rlang/blob/main/R/standalone-types-check.R\nThis is super useful because it injects selected R functions into your R package.
