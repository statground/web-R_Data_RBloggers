With no readily-available answer, John answered the question himself, by counting the number of times each function is called in all the packages available on CRAN. He then ranked the functions in two ways: first, by the <a href=\"http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2009/12/07/r-function-usage-frequencies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">total number of times each function is called</a> in all the source code for all the packages, and then by counting the <a href=\"http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2009/12/07/r-function-usage-frequencies/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">number of packages that use each function</a> at least once. The top five functions are therefore:</p><p></p><ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">if</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">c</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">function</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">length</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">list</span> (by the number of packages) or <span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">paste</span> (by number of uses)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The order varies by the method used, and technically “if” and “function” are keywords, not functions.
