Debugging issues is now easier than ever, thanks to\nclearer error messages and improved error handling.

Where ShinyProxy on\nDocker is easy to setup, it lacks some of the benefits of running ShinyProxy on\nKubernetes. By adding support for pure Docker hosts to the ShinyProxy Operator,\nwe’re closing this gap today. The support for Docker has been added to the\nexisting Kubernetes operator (without any breaking change), therefore a big part\nof the logic of the operator is shared between the Docker and Kubernetes\nversion. Just like using the operator on Kubernetes, this allows for\nzero-downtime updates of the ShinyProxy configuration and upgrades to ShinyProxy\nitself. It also integrates with Redis to provide session and app persistence. In\nshort, you can update the ShinyProxy configuration without needing to restart it\nmanually, and users won’t experience any interruptions during the process.\nAlthough Redis is required for this to work, you don’t need to install or\nconfigure it yourself, the operator handles everything automatically. The\noperator even deploys the full monitoring stack. As a final bonus, the operator\nautomatically configures TLS (using the <a href=\"https://caddyserver.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Caddy</a>\nwebserver). In conclusion, using the operator on Docker gives you many of the\nbenefits of using Kubernetes, but in a much more cost-effective way. Of course,\nShinyProxy keeps supporting Kubernetes, since it’s essential in setups that\nneeds the effortless scaling provided by Kubernetes. In the future, we even want\nto support some of the features of the Docker operator on Kubernetes as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-docker-operator.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of Docker Operator\" border=\"0\" class=\"img-responsive\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-docker-operator.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" width=\"auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Screenshot of Docker Operator\" border=\"0\" class=\"img-responsive\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-docker-operator.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"auto\"/></noscript></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"monitoring\">Monitoring</h2>\n<p>With a few apps deployed, you can manually look at logs with tools like the\nDocker and Kubernetes CLI. However, as the number of apps typically grows\nquickly, the need for better monitoring capabilities also grows. Since a long\ntime,\na <a href=\"https://github.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-monitoring\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">monitoring stack</a> is\navailable for ShinyProxy. This release further enhances the stack, making it\nmuch more user friendly. Many small changes have been made in the dashboards. To\nstart, all dashboards have a (collapsible) description, these include tips on\nusing the dashboard. Every panel now also has a help text. The filtering\ncapabilities of the dashboards have been extended, allowing you to more easily\nfind the logs or resources you are looking for. The dashboards containing\ninformation about specific apps now also show the metadata about the app (\nincluding the app state). Besides improvements to the dashboards, many technical\nimprovements were made. All components are updated to their latest version,\nwhile configuration of some components has been simplified. Finally, a technical\nlimitation has been overcome, ensuring that the logs of apps that fail (almost)\nimmediately after startup, do actually appear in Grafana. This makes the whole\nsetup more reliable. In the past, the monitoring stack was only supported on\nKubernetes. With this release, support for pure Docker hosts is added. The stack\nis integrated in the operator, which can now automatically deploy it on Docker\nhosts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-app-logs-new.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Screenshot dashboard\" border=\"0\" class=\"img-responsive\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-app-logs-new.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" width=\"auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Screenshot dashboard\" border=\"0\" class=\"img-responsive\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-app-logs-new.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"auto\"/></noscript></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"error-handling\">Error handling</h2>\n<p>As part of making ShinyProxy more enjoyable to use, the error handling has been\nimproved. ShinyProxy now better describes the reason why an app fails to\nstartup, and it can also retrieve error messages directly from the container\nbackend. The goal is for you to see all relevant information in one place. While\nan app is starting, ShinyProxy now (continuously) monitors the container’s\nhealth. If the container crashes, the user is notified immediately, rather than\nwaiting for a timeout, as in previous versions. Similar improvements have been\nmade for cases where a running app crashes.</p>\n<p>Nobody really likes reading the stack traces generated by Java. That’s why\nShinyProxy now displays the most relevant error message in a concise,\nhuman-readable format at the end of the output when a crash occurs. The complete\nstack trace is still available when the error message by itself isn’t sufficient\nfor troubleshooting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-error.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of error in ShinyProxy\" border=\"0\" class=\"img-responsive\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-error.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" width=\"auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Screenshot of error in ShinyProxy\" border=\"0\" class=\"img-responsive\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.openanalytics.eu/blog-img/shinyproxy-error.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"auto\"/></noscript></a></p>\n<p>In addition to improving error messages, we also aim to reduce the number of\nerrors ShinyProxy generates in the first place. For example, the configuration\nof memory and CPU resources has become smarter. ShinyProxy can now parse common\nnotations for these values, even if they aren’t recognized by the container\nbackend. See\nthe <a href=\"https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/#memory-and-cpu-resources\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">updated documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we’ve made significant improvements to memory usage, particularly for\nservers running many apps. In line with this, the official Docker image now\nincludes optimized Java memory settings by default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation\">Documentation</h2>\n<p>Everything you need to know about ShinyProxy is documented\non <a href=\"https://shinyproxy.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://shinyproxy.io</a>. Together with this release, we’ve extended and\nupdated the documentation. The new concepts category contains pages with\nbackground information about\nthe <a href=\"https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/concepts/app-lifecycle/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">app lifecycle</a>\nand <a href=\"https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/concepts/authentication_and_authorization/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">authentication and authorization</a>.\nThe <a href=\"https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/troubleshooting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">troubleshooting</a> page\nhas been extended with common errors and how to solve them.

Finally, a technical\nlimitation has been overcome, ensuring that the logs of apps that fail (almost)\nimmediately after startup, do actually appear in Grafana. This makes the whole\nsetup more reliable. In the past, the monitoring stack was only supported on\nKubernetes. With this release, support for pure Docker hosts is added. The stack\nis integrated in the operator, which can now automatically deploy it on Docker\nhosts.\nError handling\nAs part of making ShinyProxy more enjoyable to use, the error handling has been\nimproved. ShinyProxy now better describes the reason why an app fails to\nstartup, and it can also retrieve error messages directly from the container\nbackend. The goal is for you to see all relevant information in one place. While\nan app is starting, ShinyProxy now (continuously) monitors the container’s\nhealth. If the container crashes, the user is notified immediately, rather than\nwaiting for a timeout, as in previous versions. Similar improvements have been\nmade for cases where a running app crashes.\nNobody really likes reading the stack traces generated by Java. That’s why\nShinyProxy now displays the most relevant error message in a concise,\nhuman-readable format at the end of the output when a crash occurs. The complete\nstack trace is still available when the error message by itself isn’t sufficient\nfor troubleshooting.\nIn addition to improving error messages, we also aim to reduce the number of\nerrors ShinyProxy generates in the first place. For example, the configuration\nof memory and CPU resources has become smarter. ShinyProxy can now parse common\nnotations for these values, even if they aren’t recognized by the container\nbackend. See\nthe\nupdated documentation\n.\nFinally, we’ve made significant improvements to memory usage, particularly for\nservers running many apps. In line with this, the official Docker image now\nincludes optimized Java memory settings by default.\nDocumentation\nEverything you need to know about ShinyProxy is documented\non\nhttps://shinyproxy.io\n. Together with this release, we’ve extended and\nupdated the documentation. The new concepts category contains pages with\nbackground information about\nthe\napp lifecycle\nand\nauthentication and authorization\n.\nThe\ntroubleshooting\npage\nhas been extended with common errors and how to solve them. Finally, the\ndocumentation of the operator has been moved from GitHub to\nthe\nwebsite\n.\nFull release notes can be found on the downloads page and updated documentation\ncan be found on\nhttps://shinyproxy.io\n.
