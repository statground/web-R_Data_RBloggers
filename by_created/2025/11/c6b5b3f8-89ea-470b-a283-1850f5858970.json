He is an advocate of transparent and reproducible research, and an active developer of open source software. He maintains several statistical software libraries for R and Python, including marginaleffects, modelsummary, and tinytable.</span></p>\n<br/>\n<p><b>Description: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our world is complex. To make sense of it, data analysts routinely fit sophisticated statistical or machine learning models. Interpreting the results produced by such models can be challenging, and researchers often struggle to communicate their findings to colleagues and stakeholders. This tutorial is designed to bridge that gap. It offers a practical guide to model interpretation for analysts who wish to communicate their results in a clear and impactful way. Tutorial attendees will be introduced to the marginaleffects package and to the conceptual framework that underpins it. The marginaleffects package for R offers a single point of entry for computing and plotting predictions, counterfactual comparisons, slopes, and hypothesis tests for over 100 different types of models. The package provides a simple and unified interface, is well-documented with extensive tutorials, and is model-agnostic—ensuring that users can extract meaningful quantities regardless of the modeling framework they use. The book Model to Meaning: How to Interpret Statistical Results Using marginaleffects for R (forthcoming with CRC Chapman &amp; Hall) introduces a powerful conceptual framework to help analysts make sense of complex models. It demonstrates how to extract meaningful quantities from model outputs and communicate findings effectively using marginaleffects. This tutorial will provide participants with a deep understanding of how to use marginaleffects to improve model interpretation. Attendees will learn how to compute and visualize key statistical summaries, including marginal means, contrasts, and slopes, and how to leverage marginaleffects for hypothesis and equivalence testing. The package follows tidy principles, ensuring that results integrate seamlessly with workflows in R, and with other packages such as ggplot2, Quarto, and modelsummary. This tutorial is suitable for data scientists, researchers, analysts, and students who fit statistical models in R and seek an easy, reliable, and transparent approach to model interpretation. No advanced mathematical background is required, but familiarity with generalized linear models like logistic regression is assumed.</span></p>\n<br/>\n<p><b>Minimal registration fee: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">20 euro (or 20 USD or 800 UAH)</span></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Please note that the registration confirmation is sent 1 day before the workshop to all registered participants rather than immediately after registration</span></p>\n<br/>\n<p><b>How can I register?</b></p>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Go to </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4aD5LMC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/4aD5LMC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">  or  </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and donate</span><b> at least 20 euro</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Feel free to donate more if you can, all proceeds go directly to support Ukraine.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Save your donation receipt (after the donation is processed, there is an option to enter your email address on the website to which the donation receipt is sent)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fill in the </span><a href=\"https://forms.gle/8bTn1oiupMWxoyS77\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">registration form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, attaching a screenshot of a donation receipt (please attach the screenshot of the donation receipt that was emailed to you rather than the page you see after donation).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are not personally interested in attending, you can also contribute by sponsoring a participation of a student, who will then be able to participate for free.
