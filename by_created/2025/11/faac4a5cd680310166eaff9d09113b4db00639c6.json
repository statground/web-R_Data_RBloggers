I then switched to SQL Server when I changed jobs. A full blown client/server DB really does not make a lot of sense for much of what I do. I don’t run a transactional data store. I don’t need to have dozens of users hooked to the DB. And I do sometimes need access to my data when I am not hooked to the mother-ship. So I could run the free version of SQL Server on my laptop or run MySQL on my laptop, but both of these options rub me the wrong way. Why? I do a lot of data analysis in R which is RAM intensive. Running a DB server on my laptop means that some fraction of my RAM is going to be taken up by the db server software which is hanging out waiting for me to throw requests at it. I could manually hack around this by starting the server before I load data and then killing it after the data is loaded. That’s just too big of a pain in my rectum. Oh yeah, one more design requirement: I want to be able to push the whole DB out to a storage blob at Amazon and pound on it using EC2 machines, running Linux.
