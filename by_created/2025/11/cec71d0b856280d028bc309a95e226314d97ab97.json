I was asked to analyse a two-colour microarray dataset, so found my way with <em>limma</em> fairly clumsily, and realised that I loved exploring data and making figures with R, which set me on my eventual path to becoming a bioinformatician.

As part of our work in the facility, we developed the package <a href=\"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ngsReports.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ngsReports</a> to help as we built our own data QC workflows. There were no other Bioconductor developers in Adelaide at the time, so submitting that first Bioconductor package felt like a hugely intimidating step into a more public space. <em>What on earth was I doing out there with all the real developers who actually know what they’re doing?</em> <em>Are people going to read my code &amp; laugh?</em></p>\n<p>Since then I’ve been lucky enough to develop or contribute to a handful of additional packages, many of which I still use in my day-to-day research, and if you’re interested, you can see my BioC2023 presentation on the extraChIPs package <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6aRtBTd4NyQ?feature=shared\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

We’re hoping to make some real gains in personalised medicine for the South Australian Aboriginal community, who’ve experienced a much lower standard of medical care along with reduced access to care, and have paid a significant price with their health.
