The book, by <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2033\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Adler</a>, is called <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009427\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Baseball Hacks</a>, and I highly recommend it if you are interested in analyzing baseball data.  Joseph uses Excel for some tips, R for others, and shows you how to download historical and current baseball data for further analysis. One tip that the book offered was a way to download “real time” baseball data from <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MLB’s site</a> in XML format.

If you drill down far enough into the directories, you can find a file called miniscoreboard.xml, which is the one I use for this analysis. \n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"outline-3\" id=\"outline-container-1.2\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-1.2\">The R functions </h3>\n<div id=\"text-1.2\">\n<p>\nHere are the R functions I wrote.

The format looks like it has changed over time, which is not surprising.  I only use a very small subset of the available data, even the miniscoreboard.xml file contains far more information than I summarize here. This is really the first time I have dealt with XML data, so I am sure there is a lot more that can be done, but for a one-day project, I think the results are pretty interesting. I will definitely provide the updates I make to these functions, and may even start a baseball R package if they grow extensive enough. I suppose this is a project I can work on in the off season!  \n</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<section class=\"field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above clearfix\">\n<h2 class=\"field-label\">Tags: </h2>\n<ul class=\"field-items\">\n<li class=\"field-item even\" rel=\"dc:subject\"><a href=\"http://www.sigmafield.org/tags/r\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\">R</a></li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.0-->\n<p class=\"syndicated-attribution\"><div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"http://www.sigmafield.org/2009/10/04/using-r-to-analyze-baseball-games-in-real-time\"> sigmafield - R</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\r\n\r\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\r\n</hr></div></p> </div>\n</article>",

I admit that there may be far better ways to do this manipulation using the XML package, but this worked for now.\n################################################################################\n#   Program Name:     xml-mlb-gameday.R\n#   Author:           Erik\n#   Created:          10/04/2009\n#\n#   Last saved\n#    Time-stamp:      <2009-10-04 17:23:02 erik>\n#\n#   Purpose:          show current scoreboard in R \n#\n#   ** Generated by auto-insert on 10/04/2009 at 13:25:58**\n################################################################################\n\n## need XML package, may need to install w/ install.packages()\nlibrary(XML)\n\n## create a boxscore object from an XML description of a game \ncreateBoxScore <- function(x) {\n  status <- if(x$.attrs[\"status\"] != \"In Progress\")\n    \"Final\" else if(x$.attrs[\"top_inning\"] == \"Y\")\n      \"Top\" else \"Bot\"\n  \n  bs <- list(status = status, \n             inning = as.numeric(x$.attrs[\"inning\"]),\n             away.team = x$.attrs[\"away_name_abbrev\"],\n             away.runs = as.numeric(x$.attrs[\"away_team_runs\"]),\n             away.hits = as.numeric(x$.attrs[\"away_team_hits\"]), \n             away.errors = as.numeric(x$.attrs[\"away_team_errors\"]),\n             home.team = x$.attrs[\"home_name_abbrev\"],\n             home.runs = as.numeric(x$.attrs[\"home_team_runs\"]), \n             home.hits = as.numeric(x$.attrs[\"home_team_hits\"]), \n             home.errors = as.numeric(x$.attrs[\"home_team_errors\"]))\n  class(bs) <- \"boxscore\"\n  bs\n}\n\n## print the boxscore object in traditional format\nprint.boxscore <- function(x, ...) {\n  cat(\"     \", \"R   \", \"H  \", \"E (\",\n      x$status, \" \",\n      x$inning, \")\\n\",\n      format(x$away.team, width = 3), \" \", \n      format(x$away.runs, width = 2), \"  \", \n      format(x$away.hits, width = 2), \"  \", \n      x$away.errors, \"\\n\",\n      format(x$home.team, width = 3), \" \", \n      format(x$home.runs, width = 2), \"  \", \n      format(x$home.hits, width = 2), \"  \", \n      x$home.errors, \"\\n\\n\", sep = \"\")\n}\n\n## utility function ... \nas.data.frame.boxscore <- function(x, row.names, optional, ...) {\n  class(x) <- \"list\"\n  as.data.frame(x)\n}\n\n## This is the \"user accessible\" public function you should be calling!\n## downloads the XML data, and prints out boxscores for games on \"date\"\nboxscore <- function(date = Sys.Date()) {\n  if(date > Sys.Date())\n    stop(\"Cannot retrieve scores from the future.\")\n         \n  year  <- paste(\"year_\", format(date, \"%Y\"), \"/\", sep = \"\")\n  month <- paste(\"month_\", format(date, \"%m\"), \"/\", sep = \"\")\n  day   <- paste(\"day_\", format(date, \"%d\"), \"/\", sep = \"\")\n         \n  xmlFile <-\n    paste(\"http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/\",\n          year, month, day, \"miniscoreboard.xml\", sep = \"\")\n  xmlTree <- xmlTreeParse(xmlFile, useInternalNodes = TRUE)\n  xp <- xpathApply(xmlTree, \"//game\")\n  xmlList <- lapply(xp, xmlToList)\n\n  bs.list <- lapply(xmlList, createBoxScore)\n  names(bs.list) <-\n    paste(sapply(bs.list, \"[[\", \"away.team\"),\n                 \"@\",\n          sapply(bs.list, \"[[\", \"home.team\"))\n  bs.list\n}\nExamples of summarizing real-time baseball data\nHere is how to run some simple analyses on baseball games happening right now. This is the real value add for the idea of downloading data through R.  Obviously you could just go to your favorite sports site to find scores if you wanted to know how your team was doing, but pulling the data into R lets you further analyze the data, and even combine it with other data sources (e.g., weather).\n> ## print boxscores for games happening NOW!\n> boxscore()\n$`CWS @ DET`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nCWS  3   7  0\nDET  5  12  0\n\n$`HOU @ NYM`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nHOU  0   4  1\nNYM  4   9  0\n\n$`PIT @ CIN`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nPIT  0  10  0\nCIN  6  11  0\n\n$`WSH @ ATL`\n     R   H  E (Final 15)\nWSH  2  13  0\nATL  1  13  0\n\n$`CLE @ BOS`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nCLE  7   8  0\nBOS 12  11  0\n\n$`FLA @ PHI`\n     R   H  E (Final 10)\nFLA  6  11  1\nPHI  7  12  0\n\n$`TOR @ BAL`\n     R   H  E (Final 11)\nTOR  4   9  2\nBAL  5   8  0\n\n$`NYY @ TB`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nNYY 10  12  0\nTB   2   7  2\n\n$`KC @ MIN`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nKC   4  12  0\nMIN 13  11  0\n\n$`MIL @ STL`\n     R   H  E (Final 10)\nMIL  9  15  2\nSTL  7   7  0\n\n$`ARI @ CHC`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nARI  5   8  0\nCHC  2   6  0\n\n$`LAA @ OAK`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nLAA  5   9  1\nOAK  3  12  1\n\n$`SF @ SD`\n     R   H  E (Bot 9)\nSF   3  11  1\nSD   3   4  0\n\n$`COL @ LAD`\n     R   H  E (Top 8 )\nCOL  1   4  1\nLAD  5  12  0\n\n$`TEX @ SEA`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nTEX  3   4  0\nSEA  4   8  1 \n> ## print boxscores for a different day's games\n> boxscore(date = as.Date(\"2009-10-01\"))\n$`STL @ CIN`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nSTL 13  15  1\nCIN  0   5  0\n\n$`MIN @ DET`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nMIN  8  13  4\nDET  3   7  1\n\n$`MIL @ COL`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nMIL  2   6  0\nCOL  9  14  1\n\n$`ARI @ SF`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nARI  3   6  1\nSF   7  11  0\n\n$`TEX @ LAA`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nTEX 11  15  1\nLAA  3   7  2\n\n$`WSH @ ATL`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nWSH  2   7  0\nATL  1   6  0\n\n$`HOU @ PHI`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nHOU  5  10  0\nPHI  3  13  1\n\n$`BAL @ TB`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nBAL  3   7  0\nTB   2   5  1\n\n$`CLE @ BOS`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nCLE  0   3  0\nBOS  3  12  0\n\n$`PIT @ CHC`\n     R   H  E (Final NA)\nPIT NA  NA  NA\nCHC NA  NA  NA\n\n$`OAK @ SEA`\n     R   H  E (Final 9)\nOAK  2   7  1\nSEA  4   8  0 \n> ## save the boxscores for futher analysis\n> bs <- boxscore()\n> ## convert to a more useful form, a data.frame\n> ## with one game per row \n> bs.df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(bs, as.data.frame))\n> ## status of today's games\n> table(bs.df$status)\nFinal   Bot   Top \n   13     1     1  \n> ## how many innings have been played today? \n> sum(bs.df$inning, na.rm = TRUE)\n[1] 144 \n> ## how many runs have been scored by the home teams today?\n> sum(bs.df$home.runs, na.rm = TRUE)\n[1] 79 \n> ## how many runs have been scored by the away teams today?\n> sum(bs.df$away.runs, na.rm = TRUE)\n[1] 62\nConclusion\nThese functions are far from robust, and I think they only work for the current year (i.e., 2009, dates from 2008 were not working right). The format looks like it has changed over time, which is not surprising.  I only use a very small subset of the available data, even the miniscoreboard.xml file contains far more information than I summarize here. This is really the first time I have dealt with XML data, so I am sure there is a lot more that can be done, but for a one-day project, I think the results are pretty interesting. I will definitely provide the updates I make to these functions, and may even start a baseball R package if they grow extensive enough. I suppose this is a project I can work on in the off season!\nTags:\nR\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nsigmafield - R\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
