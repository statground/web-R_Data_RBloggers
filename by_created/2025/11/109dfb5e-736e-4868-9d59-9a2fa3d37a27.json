Among other things Amos attempted to bring SEM to the masses. The main mode of creating models in Amos is to draw them graphically. This makes it fairly easy to draw simple confirmatory factor analysis models and simple structural models. There are also many drawing tools designed to make it more efficient to draw diagrams and so on. However, the switch from simple drawing of models to testing models programmatically is a big jump, especially considering that you have to learn a programming language for something you might only use occasionally. And even drawing a single model can eventually become quite time consuming and error prone. For this and several other reasons I have been excited about the idea of running structural equation models in R. A selection of reasons why R would be a natural fit for structural equation modelling include the following:<br/><br/><b>Model comparison: </b>Bad SEM style involves a researcher saying this is my model and testing only that model and ticking the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=hu%20and%20bentler%20fit%20statistics&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=ws\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hu and Bentller fit statistics boxes</a>.

It should then be easy to additionally adjust models by for example specifying equality constraints, constraint relationships to zero and so on.<br/><br/><b>Extracting model information in R: </b>SEM produces a lot of output. This is well suited to R where this information can be stored in a list structure.
