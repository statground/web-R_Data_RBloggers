It serves as a foundation, allowing users, <strong>especially early entry-level R programmers</strong>, to develop and deploy applications with minimal coding. The framework is complemented by an array of tools, guides, documentation, and examples, making it accessible and user-friendly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unique-features\">Unique Features</h2>\n<p>What sets Teal apart is its dual focus on reproducibility and ease of use. It caters to statistical programmers transitioning from other platforms like <a href=\"https://appsilon.com/sas-vs-r-programming/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SAS</a> and lowers the entry barrier significantly. Teal’s interactive code generation and evaluation capabilities enable users to understand and recreate the code behind visualizations, fostering a deeper understanding of data manipulation and analysis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evolution\">Evolution and Open-Sourcing</h2>\n<p>Teal’s journey began with its first Git commit in 2017 with just three developers. After a period of inactivity, the project gained momentum in 2019, culminating in its open-source release in 2021. This transition marked a significant milestone, leading to widespread recognition and adoption within Roche, including its use in an FDA submission. By 2023, Teal had garnered substantial buzz, with numerous workshops and presentations showcasing its capabilities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Curious about how open-source tools  such as Teal, R Shiny and Rhino are reshaping FDA clincal trial submissions? <a href=\"https://appsilon.com/fda-clinical-trial-submissions-with-r-shiny-rhino/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dive into our insights in this comprehensive review</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"challenges\">Challenges and Lessons</h2>\n<p>The development of Teal has not been without its challenges. Key lessons include the importance of design, the necessity of automating routine tasks, and the value of continuous feedback and testing. These insights have shaped Teal’s development, ensuring it remains both robust and adaptable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"applications\">User Engagement and Applications</h2>\n<p>Teal’s versatility is evidenced by its diverse user base. From facilitating data exploration to supporting regulatory outputs, its applications are vast. Notable uses include interactive data analysis, patient profile modules, and custom module development, highlighting Teal’s adaptability to various needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"advanced-features\">Balancing User-Friendliness and Advanced Features</h2>\n<p>Maintaining a balance between simplicity for beginners and advanced capabilities for experienced users is crucial. Teal achieves this by segregating its functionalities into different layers. This layered architecture is structured to prioritize complexity and power at the base, catering to users requiring advanced capabilities. Above this is a more straightforward convenience layer, geared towards non-expert users, offering simplicity and functionality that caters to user skills. The topmost layer is designed for typical standard users, providing essential functions in an accessible way.</p>\n<h3>Teal Developers</h3>\n<p>This layered architecture creates two broad roles in using teal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Teal App Developer:</strong> Responsible for creating Teal apps using available modules. These modules are standardized and versatile, fitting various use cases. The developer integrates them into the app’s interface for user-friendliness.</li>\n<li><strong>Teal Module Developer:</strong> Focuses on building Teal modules that are adaptable and reusable, or customized for specific project needs. These modules form the basis of Teal apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This structure ensures Teal is accessible for beginners while offering advanced features for experienced users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"community\">Community Contribution and Support</h2>\n<p>Community involvement is a cornerstone of Teal’s development. Feature requests and feedback are encouraged through platforms like <a href=\"https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://pharmaverse.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-yv5atkr4-Np2ytJ6W_QKz_4Olo7Jo9A#/shared-invite/email\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a>. This collaborative approach ensures that Teal evolves in response to real-world needs and experiences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pharma-challenges\">Open-Source Challenges in Pharma</h2>\n<blockquote><p>“Industry and Pharma companies are willing to compete on the molecules, not on the tools.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Transitioning to open-source in the pharmaceutical industry presents unique challenges. Navigating these requires careful planning and a clear vision for the future. Roche’s experience with Teal offers valuable insights into this process.</p>\n<p>Transitioning to open-source in the pharmaceutical industry presents unique challenges.
