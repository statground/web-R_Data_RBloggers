From the earliest stirrings of humanity, to the patterns of complex arcana that silently control our lives today, folklore and legend have long reported phenomena that rebel against mundane description or understanding. As our technologies evolve, and our ability to collate, scrutinise, and manipulate data spiral beyond all restraint, we are ever more capable, if not indeed obliged, to bring the lens of science to bear on these harrowing mysteries.</p>\n<p>To embrace this dark season, you are invited to the annual Oxford Internet Institute Halloween Lecture.</p>\n<p>This year we will pursue one of the world’s most notorious cryptozoological phenomena, investigating over a century of data regarding sightings of the Sasquatch, or Bigfoot, of North America.
