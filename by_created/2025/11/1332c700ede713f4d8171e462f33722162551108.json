His research focuses on understanding how consumer preferences, market dynamics, and policy affect the emergence and adoption of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. He also studies the critical relationship between the US and China in developing and mass producing these technologies. He has expertise in discrete choice modeling, conjoint analysis, exploratory data analysis, interview-based research methods, and the R programming language. He speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and has conducted extensive fieldwork in China. He is also an accomplished violinist and swing dancer.

With surveydown, researchers can create reproducible, interactive surveys using markdown and R code chunks, leveraging the Quarto publication system and R shiny web application framework. While most survey platforms rely on graphical interfaces or spreadsheets to define survey content, surveydown uses plain text, enabling version control and collaboration via tools like GitHub. The package renders surveys as interactive shiny web applications, allowing for complex features like conditional skip logic, dynamic question display, and complex randomization. The package supports a diverse set of question types and formatting options and users can leverage shiny’s powerful reactive programming model to create a wide variety of customized interactive features. As an open-source tool, surveydown provides researchers full control over their survey implementation, including the survey application as well as where and how the resulting response data are stored. Workflows are entirely reproducible and integrate seamlessly with existing workflows for data collection and analysis in R. At this workshop, you’ll not only learn how to build and deploy your own interactive surveys using surveydown, but also how you can join the growing community of contributors to the project.</span></p>\n<p><b>Minimal registration fee: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">20 euro (or 20 USD or 800 UAH)</span></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Please note that the registration confirmation is sent 1 day before the workshop to all registered participants rather than immediately after registration</span></p>\n<br/>\n<p><b>How can I register?</b></p>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Go to </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4aD5LMC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/4aD5LMC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">  or  </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and donate</span><b> at least 20 euro</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Feel free to donate more if you can, all proceeds go directly to support Ukraine.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Save your donation receipt (after the donation is processed, there is an option to enter your email address on the website to which the donation receipt is sent)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fill in the </span><a href=\"https://forms.gle/k6TwewuP8cZWKWck7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">registration form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, attaching a screenshot of a donation receipt (please attach the screenshot of the donation receipt that was emailed to you rather than the page you see after donation).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are not personally interested in attending, you can also contribute by sponsoring a participation of a student, who will then be able to participate for free.
