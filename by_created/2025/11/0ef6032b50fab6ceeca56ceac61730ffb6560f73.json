Optional steps for AI integration</h3>\n<p>This next step is optional. If you are using quarto or markdown its possible to get large-language models to help with many paper writing tasks (including the writing). This is a specialized area though and I’ve only given basic technical instructions here. Actually getting it to work well is another topic altogether and something I’m still developing…</p>\n<p>Get an API key with an LLM provider (e.g. <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/sign-up\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OpenRouter</a>, <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://console.anthropic.com/login?returnTo=%2F%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a>). You’ll need a developer account to get an API key, rather than a regular account that you may already have (see links in last sentence). Buy some credits so you can use your API.</p>\n<p>Make sure you save your API key somewhere safe! You can usually only view them once on creation. You’ll need it for the workshop.</p>\n<p>Get the Roo Code extension for vscode/positron.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.roocode.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Read the documents/watch the tutorials and learn how to use Roo Code</a></p>\n<p>You can now <a href=\"https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">create a custom mode</a>, e.g. a  ‘scientific writing mode’ in Roo code. As of writing this requires clicking the mode selection button at the bottom of the Roo Code Pane, then click the Cog, then the <code>+</code> button to make a new mode. Then you need to write a ‘Role Definition’ and ‘Custom instructions’. For tools I just use ‘Read Files’, ‘Edit Files’ and unclick the others (will save you money and tokens).</p>\n<p>This is the hard part that needs a lot of thought:</p>\n<p>In the custom instructions you should write detailed instructions on how to help an author with scientific writing. For instance, you might want to put some very strong instructions about not making up references. You might also put instructions about your particular writing style preferences. I’m working on a template, but am not yet ready to share it.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Roo code documentation</a> for more advice on custom modes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-using-quarto\">5. Using quarto</h3>\n<p>Take a tutorial and <a href=\"https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">learn how to use Quarto</a>.</p>\n<p>For academic paper writing the key things to understand from the Quarto tutorial are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to knit as word or pdf (pdf requires extra software installations)</li>\n<li>Formatting, headings, bold etc…</li>\n<li>YAML frontmatter for styles, linking a bibliography and bibliography style</li>\n<li>How to insert images and/or code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note on AI integration</strong> once you are using quarto and Roo Code you can simply ask Roo Code to do things in your document (like outline a paper template) by referencing the file (e.g. @myfile.qmd) in the prompt box.</p>\n<p>Whether this works well for you is another questions. Prompting well requires a lot of thought and practice. Its not simply going to write a paper for you. You have to give the AI assistant detailed, specific, instructions and lots of context.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-yaml-front-matter\">6. YAML front matter</h3>\n<p>The <code>YAML</code> controls how your qmd document is rendered. Here’s an example of mine:</p>\n<pre>---\ntitle: \"The paper's title\"\nformat: docx\neditor: visual\nbibliography: mybib.bib\ncsl: myjournal.csl\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  message: false\n  warning: false\n---\n</pre>\n<p>This goes at the top of your document. A few key points.</p>\n<p><code>format</code> controls document type to render this as, here a word doc.</p>\n<p><code>editor</code> controls how it is viewed in vscode. Options are <code>editor: visual</code> and <code>editor: source</code>. Visual looks more like a word doc, source looks more like markdown. You’ll have to save and re-open the document for this to change.</p>\n<p><code>bibliography</code> links to a bibtex file where your references are stored.</p>\n<p><code>csl</code> links to a style guide for the bibliography.</p>\n<p>More on styles and references below.</p>\n<p><code>execute</code> is controlling how R code is run and if the R code appears in the document.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-rendering-as-a-document\">7. Rendering as a document</h3>\n<p>Use the short-cut key ‘cmd-shift-K’/’cntrl-shft-k’ (mac/windows) to preview your document. It will also create a rendered version in your current directory.</p>\n<p>Its helpful to set: <code>format: html</code> when you are writing the document, then you get a live preview in vscode. Use  <code>format: docx</code> when you want a word document.</p>\n<p>Its worth also learning the short-cut `cmd-shft-p’/’cntrl-shft-p’, this brings up searchable actions for all extensions in vscode. The one you want is ‘Quarto: preview’ which does the same as the shortcut above.</p>\n<p>I tend to have minimal R code in my quarto manuscript. Or none at all (just reference .png files for figures). This keeps rendering quick. Also your document can get unweildy if there is a lot of text mixed in with R code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-word-counts\">8. Word counts</h3>\n<p>There are various word count extensions for vscode qmd and md documents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-document-styles\">9. Document styles</h3>\n<p>Getting a word document to follow a particular style is a bit fiddly. You need to set-up a template word document with styles the include that as a reference in your YAML.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">See instructions here.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"10-reference-manager-integration\">10. Reference manager integration</h3>\n<p>Quarto integrates with many different reference managers. <a href=\"https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">There’s a good guide here</a>.</p>\n<p>In brief you create a <code>.bib</code> file that has your references in it. This is then linked in the YAML. The manual way to manage this is just to create a <code>.bib</code> file and paste bibtext entries directly into it (available on most journal’s pages as a citation format, as well as google scholar).</p>\n<p>e.g. the bibtext for R looks like this:</p>\n<pre>@Manual{Rlanguage,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = ,\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n</pre>\n<p>Then in quarto you just type <code>@</code> and a dropdown of all your references will appear. <code>@Manual{Rlanguage,</code> the Rlanguage bit is the CiteKey that will appear in the dropdown. So <code>@Rlanguage</code> will insert that reference into the bibliography and the citation at that place in the document.</p>\n<p>You can streamline the process of gathering and managing references with a reference manager.</p>\n<p>My workflow in Zotero is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Zotero on my computer</li>\n<li>Go to journal webpage for paper</li>\n<li>Use zotero plugin to my browser to grab the citation and save it to a library</li>\n<li>Go to my quarto document in VScode</li>\n<li>type <code>@</code> and a drop down of all references in all libraries on zotero appears. Pick the one I want.</li>\n<li>Click the <code>OK</code> button which saves that reference into my local <code>.bib</code> file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For some reason (that does not seem to be documented in any quarto tutorials anywhere!) it will find any reference I have anywhere in zotero and then save that bibtex entry to my local <code>.bib</code> file, so it is now accessible for use in my quarto doc. This only works if I have zotero open and use <code>editor: visual</code> in the YAML.</p>\n<p>There are many other options however.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-optional-ai-integration-for-reference-management\">11. Optional AI integration for reference management</h3>\n<p>You can get AI assistants to help with referencing if you keep your notes on papers linked to your references. For instance, you could keep your notes on references in the bibtex field for <code>notes</code>. Alternatively you could create another quarto/markdown document that has a header for each citation tag along with its notes in a structured way:</p>\n<pre>## Rlanguage \n\n### What it is\n\nThe R software for scientific computing. \n\n### Usage\n\nCitation for the R software. Use this at least once in every paper where i've used R for statistics\n\n## edgar2023continent\n\n### What is it\n\nKey paper that shows Australia is losing its marine biodiversity. \n\n### Usage\n\nCite this as evidence that Australia is losing coastal marine biodiversity and as evidence that climate change is causing marine biodiversity loss\n\n</pre>\n<p>It doesn’t matter how you do this, so long as you follow a consistent structure. I’ve used the CiteKey as the main header for each reference entry. Then I’ve put in markdown sections about each paper and why I might wnat to cite it. Then you can get Roo Code to help with inserting references.</p>\n<p>Note that if you are using the <code>.bib</code> directly just be careful not to plagiarise! Roo Code might insert excerpts from the abstracts/titles directly into your written document, which is a no-no for publishing.</p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"http://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2025/07/07/writing-papers-with-quarto.html\"> Bluecology blog</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr/>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\n\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\n</div> </div>\n</article>",

Buy some credits so you can use your API.\nMake sure you save your API key somewhere safe! You can usually only view them once on creation. You’ll need it for the workshop.\nGet the Roo Code extension for vscode/positron.\nRead the documents/watch the tutorials and learn how to use Roo Code\nYou can now\ncreate a custom mode\n, e.g. a  ‘scientific writing mode’ in Roo code. As of writing this requires clicking the mode selection button at the bottom of the Roo Code Pane, then click the Cog, then the\n+\nbutton to make a new mode. Then you need to write a ‘Role Definition’ and ‘Custom instructions’. For tools I just use ‘Read Files’, ‘Edit Files’ and unclick the others (will save you money and tokens).\nThis is the hard part that needs a lot of thought:\nIn the custom instructions you should write detailed instructions on how to help an author with scientific writing. For instance, you might want to put some very strong instructions about not making up references. You might also put instructions about your particular writing style preferences. I’m working on a template, but am not yet ready to share it.\nSee\nRoo code documentation\nfor more advice on custom modes.\n5. Using quarto\nTake a tutorial and\nlearn how to use Quarto\n.\nFor academic paper writing the key things to understand from the Quarto tutorial are:\nHow to knit as word or pdf (pdf requires extra software installations)\nFormatting, headings, bold etc…\nYAML frontmatter for styles, linking a bibliography and bibliography style\nHow to insert images and/or code.\nNote on AI integration\nonce you are using quarto and Roo Code you can simply ask Roo Code to do things in your document (like outline a paper template) by referencing the file (e.g. @myfile.qmd) in the prompt box.\nWhether this works well for you is another questions. Prompting well requires a lot of thought and practice. Its not simply going to write a paper for you. You have to give the AI assistant detailed, specific, instructions and lots of context.\n6. YAML front matter\nThe\nYAML\ncontrols how your qmd document is rendered. Here’s an example of mine:\n---\ntitle: \"The paper's title\"\nformat: docx\neditor: visual\nbibliography: mybib.bib\ncsl: myjournal.csl\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  message: false\n  warning: false\n---\nThis goes at the top of your document. A few key points.\nformat\ncontrols document type to render this as, here a word doc.\neditor\ncontrols how it is viewed in vscode. Options are\neditor: visual\nand\neditor: source\n. Visual looks more like a word doc, source looks more like markdown. You’ll have to save and re-open the document for this to change.\nbibliography\nlinks to a bibtex file where your references are stored.\ncsl\nlinks to a style guide for the bibliography.\nMore on styles and references below.\nexecute\nis controlling how R code is run and if the R code appears in the document.\n7. Rendering as a document\nUse the short-cut key ‘cmd-shift-K’/’cntrl-shft-k’ (mac/windows) to preview your document. It will also create a rendered version in your current directory.\nIts helpful to set:\nformat: html\nwhen you are writing the document, then you get a live preview in vscode. Use\nformat: docx\nwhen you want a word document.\nIts worth also learning the short-cut `cmd-shft-p’/’cntrl-shft-p’, this brings up searchable actions for all extensions in vscode. The one you want is ‘Quarto: preview’ which does the same as the shortcut above.\nI tend to have minimal R code in my quarto manuscript. Or none at all (just reference .png files for figures). This keeps rendering quick. Also your document can get unweildy if there is a lot of text mixed in with R code.\n8. Word counts\nThere are various word count extensions for vscode qmd and md documents.\n9. Document styles\nGetting a word document to follow a particular style is a bit fiddly. You need to set-up a template word document with styles the include that as a reference in your YAML.\nSee instructions here.\n10. Reference manager integration\nQuarto integrates with many different reference managers.\nThere’s a good guide here\n.\nIn brief you create a\n.bib\nfile that has your references in it. This is then linked in the YAML. The manual way to manage this is just to create a\n.bib\nfile and paste bibtext entries directly into it (available on most journal’s pages as a citation format, as well as google scholar).\ne.g. the bibtext for R looks like this:\n@Manual{Rlanguage,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = ,\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2024},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\nThen in quarto you just type\n@\nand a dropdown of all your references will appear.\n@Manual{Rlanguage,\nthe Rlanguage bit is the CiteKey that will appear in the dropdown. So\n@Rlanguage\nwill insert that reference into the bibliography and the citation at that place in the document.\nYou can streamline the process of gathering and managing references with a reference manager.\nMy workflow in Zotero is as follows:\nOpen Zotero on my computer\nGo to journal webpage for paper\nUse zotero plugin to my browser to grab the citation and save it to a library\nGo to my quarto document in VScode\ntype\n@\nand a drop down of all references in all libraries on zotero appears. Pick the one I want.\nClick the\nOK\nbutton which saves that reference into my local\n.bib\nfile.\nFor some reason (that does not seem to be documented in any quarto tutorials anywhere!) it will find any reference I have anywhere in zotero and then save that bibtex entry to my local\n.bib\nfile, so it is now accessible for use in my quarto doc. This only works if I have zotero open and use\neditor: visual\nin the YAML.\nThere are many other options however.\n11. Optional AI integration for reference management\nYou can get AI assistants to help with referencing if you keep your notes on papers linked to your references. For instance, you could keep your notes on references in the bibtex field for\nnotes\n. Alternatively you could create another quarto/markdown document that has a header for each citation tag along with its notes in a structured way:\n## Rlanguage \n\n### What it is\n\nThe R software for scientific computing. \n\n### Usage\n\nCitation for the R software. Use this at least once in every paper where i've used R for statistics\n\n## edgar2023continent\n\n### What is it\n\nKey paper that shows Australia is losing its marine biodiversity. \n\n### Usage\n\nCite this as evidence that Australia is losing coastal marine biodiversity and as evidence that climate change is causing marine biodiversity loss\nIt doesn’t matter how you do this, so long as you follow a consistent structure. I’ve used the CiteKey as the main header for each reference entry. Then I’ve put in markdown sections about each paper and why I might wnat to cite it. Then you can get Roo Code to help with inserting references.\nNote that if you are using the\n.bib\ndirectly just be careful not to plagiarise! Roo Code might insert excerpts from the abstracts/titles directly into your written document, which is a no-no for publishing.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nBluecology blog\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
