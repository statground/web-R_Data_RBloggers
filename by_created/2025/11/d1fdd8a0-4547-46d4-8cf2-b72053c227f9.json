The project focused on consolidating numerous tech notes and READMEs\ninto a unified and easily navigable <a href=\"https://docs.r-universe.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Quarto website</a>,\nhighlighting best practices and guiding users to maximize the platform’s features.</p>\n<p>These enhancements have resulted in even more users and projects joining R-Universe.\nWe saw more than a doubling of traffic, and R-Universe has become the distribution\nplatform of choice for anchor community projects like\n<a href=\"https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/announcement-stan-r-packages-repo-deprecated-moving-to-r-universe/35341\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Stan</a>,\n<a href=\"https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/index.html?version=main&amp;environment=r\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">DuckDB</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://pola-rs.github.io/r-polars/vignettes/install.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Polars</a>,\nand we’ve seen the creation of new community initiatives that build on R-Universe,\nlike <a href=\"https://r-multiverse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">R-Multiverse</a>!</p>\n<p>For 2025, we have once again been awarded support by the R-Consortium, now\nbeing <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/12/03/r-universe-r-consortium-tlp/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">named a top-level consortium project</a>!\nWith this long-term support, we will be investing even more in making R-Universe\na platform that supports building large-scale, collaborative repositories that\nexperiment with new models for release, reproducibility, and governance.</p>\n<h2>\nSoftware Peer Review\n</h2><p>In 2024, rOpenSci’s software peer review program continued to grow,\nshowcasing our community’s commitment to improving software quality and\nvalidating R packages for a variety of applications.</p>\n<p>We’ve had <strong>17</strong> packages successfully complete software peer review with the help of about <strong>33</strong> reviewers\nand <strong>11</strong> editors, with <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/authors/emi-tanaka\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">three</a> new <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/07/03/editors2024/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">editors</a>. We also did the <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/620\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">first bilingual review</a> in English and Spanish.</p>\n<p>We also streamlined the review process and provided transparency through regular updates\non the number of submissions, approvals,\nand the status of packages under review. These updates were shared through newsletters,\nour Slack and our open GitHub organization.\nWe built a new <a href=\"https://dashboard.ropensci.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dashboard</a> to monitor the health and responsiveness of our system for authors, reviewers, and editors.\nPeer review remains a cornerstone of how we maintain quality and reproducibility in R software development\nand how we build community.</p>\n<p>In the year ahead, we are going to keep pushing our tooling to make review more\nefficient and helpful, and we have plans to do more to make our\nsoftware peer-review process a tool that other organizations can use to curate\ntheir own software ecosystems and build collaborations and community.</p>\n<h2>\nMultilingual Resources\n</h2><p>In 2024, we worked hard to expanded our multilingual resources. We finished translating\nour core resource, the <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/03/11/devguide-0.9.0/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">“rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review”\ninto Spanish</a>. This has been the central project\naround which we developed our multilingual toolkit, including packages like\n<a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/babeldown/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">babeldown</a> and\n<a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/babelquarto/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">babelquarto</a>, that facilitate LLM-supported\ntranslation workflows.\nThis work also led to our <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2024/12/17/localization-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">rOpenSci Localization and Translation Guidelines</a>\nwhich we published in Spanish and English to assist our community as well as other groups in translating and localizing open science resources.</p>\n<p>We hosted a series of great community events on multilingual publishing,\nlike our <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/commcalls/translation-portuguese/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">first Portuguese Community Call</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/projects/7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">our first Traslathon</a>, which reinforced the\nimportance of breaking language barriers in open science.</p>\n<p>What’s happening with translation in 2025? <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/projects/7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Portuguese translations of the development guide are underway</a>,\nsupported by dedicated community volunteers.

    "main_text": "rOpenSci 2024 Highlights\nPosted on\nJanuary 21, 2025\nby\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nIn 2024, we remained committed to open science and open source software.\nWe continued to build a welcoming and\ninclusive community, through innovation and collaboration.\nHere are the highlights of the year:\nR-Universe\nR-Universe, rOpenSci’s platform for finding and publishing R packages,\nsaw major advancements in 2024,\nmaking it an increasingly useful and trusted resource for the wider R community.\nSome of the highlights of our work have included a big rewrite of the\nweb frontend\nand search engine to serve faster, beautiful, informative webpages, and\nsearch through tens of thousands\npackages\n,\narticles\nand\ndatasets\n.\nOn the build side we added support for new tools like Rust and Quarto,\nand improved the process of building binaries for WebAssembly and Apple Silicon.\nMoreover, we received a\nGoogle Season of Docs grant\n, aimed at centralizing the\ndocumentation. The project focused on consolidating numerous tech notes and READMEs\ninto a unified and easily navigable\nQuarto website\n,\nhighlighting best practices and guiding users to maximize the platform’s features.\nThese enhancements have resulted in even more users and projects joining R-Universe.\nWe saw more than a doubling of traffic, and R-Universe has become the distribution\nplatform of choice for anchor community projects like\nStan\n,\nDuckDB\n,\nand\nPolars\n,\nand we’ve seen the creation of new community initiatives that build on R-Universe,\nlike\nR-Multiverse\n!\nFor 2025, we have once again been awarded support by the R-Consortium, now\nbeing\nnamed a top-level consortium project\n!\nWith this long-term support, we will be investing even more in making R-Universe\na platform that supports building large-scale, collaborative repositories that\nexperiment with new models for release, reproducibility, and governance.\nSoftware Peer Review\nIn 2024, rOpenSci’s software peer review program continued to grow,\nshowcasing our community’s commitment to improving software quality and\nvalidating R packages for a variety of applications.\nWe’ve had\n17\npackages successfully complete software peer review with the help of about\n33\nreviewers\nand\n11\neditors, with\nthree\nnew\neditors\n. We also did the\nfirst bilingual review\nin English and Spanish.\nWe also streamlined the review process and provided transparency through regular updates\non the number of submissions, approvals,\nand the status of packages under review. These updates were shared through newsletters,\nour Slack and our open GitHub organization.\nWe built a new\ndashboard\nto monitor the health and responsiveness of our system for authors, reviewers, and editors.\nPeer review remains a cornerstone of how we maintain quality and reproducibility in R software development\nand how we build community.\nIn the year ahead, we are going to keep pushing our tooling to make review more\nefficient and helpful, and we have plans to do more to make our\nsoftware peer-review process a tool that other organizations can use to curate\ntheir own software ecosystems and build collaborations and community.\nMultilingual Resources\nIn 2024, we worked hard to expanded our multilingual resources. We finished translating\nour core resource, the\n“rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review”\ninto Spanish\n. This has been the central project\naround which we developed our multilingual toolkit, including packages like\nbabeldown\nand\nbabelquarto\n, that facilitate LLM-supported\ntranslation workflows.\nThis work also led to our\nrOpenSci Localization and Translation Guidelines\nwhich we published in Spanish and English to assist our community as well as other groups in translating and localizing open science resources.\nWe hosted a series of great community events on multilingual publishing,\nlike our\nfirst Portuguese Community Call\nand\nour first Traslathon\n, which reinforced the\nimportance of breaking language barriers in open science.\nWhat’s happening with translation in 2025?\nPortuguese translations of the development guide are underway\n,\nsupported by dedicated community volunteers. It’s been inspiring to see the enthusiasm from contributors\nand volunteers driving this effort forward, and we will be giving it an extra push with additional support of our\nnew\nCZI-funded Latin America program\n. We are also\nin the midst of Spanish-language revisions of our website and Champions programs materials.\nChampions Program\nWe had an inspiring 2024 with the\nsecond cohort of our Champions Program\n.\nThese leaders have tackled projects that span disciplines and geographies,\ndriving open science and open data initiatives with creativity and\nlocal impact.\nPackage development is most common type of project tackled by our Champions,\nbut some have also taken on the challenge of becoming reviewers in our software peer-review community.\nMultilingualism plays an important role in the Champions Program,\nand this year, as part of their outreach activity, Champions put on events and workshops\nin\nTurkish\n,\nSpanish\n,\nPortuguese\n,\nChinese and, of course, English.\nIn 2025, we will run our first cohort of Champions with a fully Spanish-language\ncurriculum, under the\nsupport of our new Latin America focus program, funded by CZI\n.\nWe are also excited to be working on new models and partnerships for the Champions Program\nto make it more sustainable and self-supporting, and to be follow up\nwith our first cohort of Champions (2022-2023) to better understand the long-term impacts of this program.\nCommunity Engagement\nThis past year we’ve had 49 new code contributors to rOpenSci packages.\nOther community members shared new\nuse cases\nto help package authors see how their work is\nbeing used and to help other users see how these packages might be used.\nOur blog featured many different voices and experiences during 2024.\nWe have a total of 35 community authors, of which 18 are first time community authors!\nCounting our staff, 42 authors wrote 54 blog posts, 63% of which were written by community authors\nand 13% were multilingual.\nWe also celebrated our vibrant package ecosystem with the\n“A Package a Day”\ncampaign on Mastodon and\nWeekly Package Digests\nin LinkedIn.\nThese efforts showcased the incredible diversity of our over\n300 federated open-source packages.\nCommunity Calls and virtual Social Coworking and Office Hours\nbrought together people from over 20 countries to learn,\nget their own work done\nand to join in some spirited scavenger hunts!\nMany others have continued to\nread our newsletter\n,\ncite our software,\nask or answer questions\n,\nopen issues to report bugs or request features,\nweigh in on standards and best practices,\ninvite us\nto talk about our work\n,\nor mentioned us in presentations, posts, or social media.\nWe will continue to support our community’s amazing contributions and plan to offer even more opportunities to get involved in 2025.
