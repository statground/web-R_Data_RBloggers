Ari brought so much to the pharmaverse council in his 2 years with us, including amazing technical work to make our site homepage as visually appealing as it is today with our hexwall and contributor network graph, plus impactful presentations at PHUSE and beyond.

Julia has been a statistical programmer at Novo Nordisk for over 5 years. She began her career as a statistical programmer and is now a statistical programming project lead within the Rare Disease area. As an R, SAS, and Python user, Julia is dedicated to leveraging her programming skills to drive innovation within the organization.
