(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nSince the initial launch in 2021, our\nR-universe\nplatform has steadily grown into a comprehensive infrastructure for publishing and discovering R material.\nAs functionality keeps evolving and community adoption increases, we felt the need for a central documentation point.\nNew features and developments are generally discussed in the\nissue tracker\nor\ndiscussion board\n, and sometimes on the\nrOpenSci blog\n.\nTechnical details can be found in the README files and source code of the respective repositories under\nr-universe-org\nthat contain all the workflows, actions, and server code (the R-universe system is entirely open source).\nThis fragmentation can make it difficult to find up-to-date information, especially for new users.\nThanks to funding by\nGoogle Season of Docs\n, we were able to start a new comprehensive documentation project for all users and developers of R-universe.\nWe established a central place where we collect the various sources of information and describe examples and use cases, using popular authoring tools to support collective maintenance.\nNew r-universe docs\nThe new R-universe documentation website is now live at\nhttps://docs.r-universe.org\n.\nYou can find the source code on\nGitHub\n.\nWe created it as a\nQuarto book\nas this is a common format that many members of the R community are used to reading (for instance in\nR Packages\n,\nR for Data Science\n,\nour development guide\n1\n) and can contribute to.\nThe documentation is currently organized into four main sections:\nBrowse\nthat documents the user experience navigating packages and universes.\nInstall\nthat explains how to install packages from R-universe, how to ensure reproducibility, and how to create a dependency on a package published on R-universe.\nPublish\nthat focuses on the package developer experience: why and how to publish packages.\nInfrastructure\n, documenting governance, funding, and how R-universe works under the hood for those who want to contribute. (A work in progress!)\nIn addition the website has search functionality, and features links to the GitHub repository where you can contribute to the documentation.\nWe are thankful to the documentation reviewers\nLluís Revilla\nand\nYaoxiang Li\nwho provided insightful feedback that helped us improve the initial version of the website.\nInteractive website tour\nBesides a new docs site, we also added some\nembedded\ndocumentation into the website: each package page has a\n“Website tour” button\nin the navbar, that guides you through all the information displayed on the page.\nGo give it a try!\n2\nA streamlined docs experience\nWhile working on the documentation we also updated other information sources:\nWe simplified the\nR-universe project page on the rOpenSci website\nthe be easier to maintain. It now contains a big-picture description of the project, as well as links to relevant resources including the documentation website, technical notes, recent talk recordings.\nThat web page is also available in\nSpanish\n.\nThe README on the\norganization profile on GitHub\nwas updated to list relevant websites and online spaces such as the docs, obviously, but also the discussion board and general issue tracker.\nThe former\nFAQ list\nwas retired and replaced with links to relevant docs chapters, and references on where to get help and participate to the project.\nConclusion\nThe new docs project will become the central place where we maintain up-to-date information for users and developers of R-universe.\nThe initial version of the site has the most important bits, but is far from complete.\nJust like R-universe itself, the documentation is a living project that has to grow iteratively based on your needs and contributions.\nIf you have used R-universe in one way or another, and have ideas on how documentation could be improved, we welcome your\ncontributions\n.\nOur dev guide is a special Quarto book, as it has multilingual support thanks to our R package\nbabelquarto\n.\n↩︎\nThe tour is not available on mobile.\n↩︎\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
