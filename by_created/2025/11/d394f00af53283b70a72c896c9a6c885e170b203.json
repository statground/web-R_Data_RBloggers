Yet their estimation often suffers from convergence issues and computational inefficiency, especially in large-scale applications. The latent R package addresses these challenges by providing a fast, flexible, and robust framework for latent variable modeling. Written in C++ and fully compatible with lavaan syntax, latent currently supports Factor Analysis and Latent Class Analysis, with planned extensions to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Item Response Theory (IRT), and Mixture Modeling. This presentation introduces the package’s core design, modeling capabilities, and optimization strategies, emphasizing its suitability for models that are otherwise computationally prohibitive. At the center of latent is an innovative optimization framework based on matrix manifolds, which ensures convergence by estimating covariance matrices over the partially oblique manifold. The package’s scalability is demonstrated through applications to personality data, showing that it consistently yields positive semi-definite solutions and avoids Ultra-Heywood cases in Factor Analysis. In addition, latent tackles local maxima in factor rotation and latent class models via fast, parallel estimation from multiple starting values. It also enables rapid computation of polychoric correlation matrices across hundreds of variables. Altogether, latent offers a high-performance, open-source solution for researchers needing both speed and generality in latent variable modeling.</span></p>\n<br/>\n<p><b>Minimal registration fee: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">20 euro (or 20 USD or 800 UAH)</span></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Please note that the registration confirmation is sent 1 day before the workshop to all registered participants rather than immediately after registration</span></p>\n<br/>\n<p><b>How can I register?</b></p>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Go to </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3wvwMA6</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/4aD5LMC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/4aD5LMC</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">  or  </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://bit.ly/3PFxtNA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and donate</span><b> at least 20 euro</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Feel free to donate more if you can, all proceeds go directly to support Ukraine.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Save your donation receipt (after the donation is processed, there is an option to enter your email address on the website to which the donation receipt is sent)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fill in the </span><a href=\"https://forms.gle/bKJAG5EC62196o8z5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">registration form</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, attaching a screenshot of a donation receipt (please attach the screenshot of the donation receipt that was emailed to you rather than the page you see after donation).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are not personally interested in attending, you can also contribute by sponsoring a participation of a student, who will then be able to participate for free.
