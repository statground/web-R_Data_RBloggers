This blog post isn’t about recommending or endorsing any specific IDE, but more about what questions you might want to ask yourself before you make your own decision.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This blog post is written from the perspective of someone who uses an IDE when working on data wrangling and modelling tasks, building charts with code, and doing front-end development. However, it should also be useful even if you primarily use an IDE for something else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-an-ide\">What is an IDE?\n<a href=\"https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/#what-is-an-ide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h2>\n<p>I’ve mentioned the term <em>IDE</em> several times already, but I haven’t actually mentioned what I mean by that yet. IDE stands for <em>Integrated Development Environment</em> – which doesn’t necessarily clear up what it is! An IDE is essentially an application you can install on your laptop which provides a (nice) user interface when writing and developing code. Some IDEs you may have heard of are VS Code (Visual Studio Code), Jupyter Notebook, or RStudio.</p>\n<h2 id=\"questions-to-ask-yourself\">Questions to ask yourself\n<a href=\"https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/#questions-to-ask-yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h2>\n<p>If you’re just getting started with programming, or about to start teaching computer science next semester, or setting up a new laptop; you might be thinking about which IDE you’re going to install. These are a few questions that I think it’s important to consider before you decide what to download.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-you-really-need-a-new-ide\">Do you really need a new IDE?\n<a href=\"https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/#do-you-really-need-a-new-ide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h3>\n<p>If you’re brand new to programming and have never installed an IDE before, feel free to skip ahead to the next question. But if you already have an IDE installed and set up, why are you thinking about changing to a different one? If there’s a specific feature missing in your current set up that you would really benefit from, then switching to another IDE that has that feature might make a lot of sense. But if your current set up is working well, think about why you’re really considering using something else. Are you just worried about missing out on the shiny, new thing? Or going to be working with a new team who all use a different IDE to you? Not needing a new IDE doesn’t always mean don’t switch but <em>if ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"how-easy-is-it-to-install-and-update\">How easy is it to install and update?\n<a href=\"https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/#how-easy-is-it-to-install-and-update\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h3>\n<p>Most IDEs can be installed by downloading an installer package from the IDE’s official website and then running it on your laptop. However, some IDEs (especially newly developed ones) may only be installed through a package manager like Homebrew on macOS or apt on Linux. If you’re new to programming, you’ll likely find it easier to download and install software using an installer from the IDEs website.</p>\n<p>Widely used and popular IDEs are likely better (or perhaps the only) choices if you’re working in organisations where there are restrictions on the software you are able to install. And if you’re forced to use one IDE all day at work, it might become more familiar and so it’s easier to use the same set up for personal projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-features-do-you-need-in-an-ide\">What features do you need in an IDE?\n<a href=\"https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/#what-features-do-you-need-in-an-ide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h3>\n<p>If you’re considering switching from your current IDE to something new, there’s likely something that your current set up is <em>missing</em>. Write down a list of features that are absolutely essential for your day-to-day work.</p>\n<p>Some common features might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration with git</li>\n<li>Syntax highlighting for your programming language of choice</li>\n<li>Built-in file browser</li>\n<li>Ability to view charts</li>\n<li>Live preview of HTML documents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider to what extent these required features are available in the new IDE you are considering. Are they always available? Are they only partially available? For example, do you need a GUI (graphical user interface) for working with git, or are you happy working from a terminal? For example, in RStudio, there’s no GUI for git unless you’re working in an R project. Although R projects are really useful, you might not want to create one every time – especially if you’re working on something simple.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"A screenshot of RStudio with a git pane.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/images/rstudio1.png?w=48%25&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"A screenshot of RStudio with a git pane.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/images/rstudio1.png?w=48%25&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript>\n<img alt=\"A screenshot of RStudio with no git pane.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/images/rstudio2.png?w=48%25&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"A screenshot of RStudio with no git pane.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/images/rstudio2.png?w=48%25&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript>\n<br/><small>The GUI for git in RStudio only appears if you are in a git repository AND in an R project.</small>\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-many-features-do-you-need\">How many features do you need?\n<a href=\"https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/#how-many-features-do-you-need\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h3>\n<p>If the IDE you are considering has all of the features you <em>need</em>, think about how many other features it might also have. For those involved in teaching programming, you might not just be thinking about an IDE for yourself but also for your students. An IDE that has fewer features may be less overwhelming for those who are new to programming as they’re unlikely to immediately require all of those features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-you-want-to-customise-it\">How much do you want to customise it?\n<a href=\"https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/how-choose-ide/#how-much-do-you-want-to-customise-it\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h3>\n<p>Most IDEs allow you to customise simple aesthetic features like the colour scheme or font size reasonably easily. But you may want further customisation, like changing the layout or your own keyboard shortcuts.

      "main_text": "How to choose an IDE\nPosted on\nJuly 10, 2025\nby\nR on Nicola Rennie\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nR on Nicola Rennie\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nWhen it comes to choosing an IDE to install there are lots of different choices out there, each with different pros and cons. This blog post isn’t about recommending or endorsing any specific IDE, but more about what questions you might want to ask yourself before you make your own decision.\nThis blog post is written from the perspective of someone who uses an IDE when working on data wrangling and modelling tasks, building charts with code, and doing front-end development. However, it should also be useful even if you primarily use an IDE for something else.\nWhat is an IDE?\nI’ve mentioned the term\nIDE\nseveral times already, but I haven’t actually mentioned what I mean by that yet. IDE stands for\nIntegrated Development Environment\n– which doesn’t necessarily clear up what it is! An IDE is essentially an application you can install on your laptop which provides a (nice) user interface when writing and developing code. Some IDEs you may have heard of are VS Code (Visual Studio Code), Jupyter Notebook, or RStudio.\nQuestions to ask yourself\nIf you’re just getting started with programming, or about to start teaching computer science next semester, or setting up a new laptop; you might be thinking about which IDE you’re going to install. These are a few questions that I think it’s important to consider before you decide what to download.\nDo you really need a new IDE?\nIf you’re brand new to programming and have never installed an IDE before, feel free to skip ahead to the next question. But if you already have an IDE installed and set up, why are you thinking about changing to a different one? If there’s a specific feature missing in your current set up that you would really benefit from, then switching to another IDE that has that feature might make a lot of sense. But if your current set up is working well, think about why you’re really considering using something else. Are you just worried about missing out on the shiny, new thing? Or going to be working with a new team who all use a different IDE to you? Not needing a new IDE doesn’t always mean don’t switch but\nif ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\nHow easy is it to install and update?\nMost IDEs can be installed by downloading an installer package from the IDE’s official website and then running it on your laptop. However, some IDEs (especially newly developed ones) may only be installed through a package manager like Homebrew on macOS or apt on Linux. If you’re new to programming, you’ll likely find it easier to download and install software using an installer from the IDEs website.\nWidely used and popular IDEs are likely better (or perhaps the only) choices if you’re working in organisations where there are restrictions on the software you are able to install. And if you’re forced to use one IDE all day at work, it might become more familiar and so it’s easier to use the same set up for personal projects.\nWhat features do you need in an IDE?\nIf you’re considering switching from your current IDE to something new, there’s likely something that your current set up is\nmissing\n. Write down a list of features that are absolutely essential for your day-to-day work.\nSome common features might include:\nIntegration with git\nSyntax highlighting for your programming language of choice\nBuilt-in file browser\nAbility to view charts\nLive preview of HTML documents\nConsider to what extent these required features are available in the new IDE you are considering. Are they always available? Are they only partially available? For example, do you need a GUI (graphical user interface) for working with git, or are you happy working from a terminal? For example, in RStudio, there’s no GUI for git unless you’re working in an R project. Although R projects are really useful, you might not want to create one every time – especially if you’re working on something simple.\nThe GUI for git in RStudio only appears if you are in a git repository AND in an R project.\nHow many features do you need?\nIf the IDE you are considering has all of the features you\nneed\n, think about how many other features it might also have. For those involved in teaching programming, you might not just be thinking about an IDE for yourself but also for your students. An IDE that has fewer features may be less overwhelming for those who are new to programming as they’re unlikely to immediately require all of those features.\nHow much do you want to customise it?\nMost IDEs allow you to customise simple aesthetic features like the colour scheme or font size reasonably easily. But you may want further customisation, like changing the layout or your own keyboard shortcuts. You might want to investigate how easy these customisations are to do, and how easy it is to make sure they persist across different sessions. If you don’t know how to make your customisations and are struggling to find information about how to do it in a specific IDE, but it’s something you really want to do – maybe reconsider that choice of IDE!\nCustomisation isn’t always about adding features, it’s also about removing features you don’t want. If you really hate clutter and not being able to remove it, then a simple text editor might actually be a good option.\nHow much does having a single IDE really matter to you?\nThere are plenty of IDEs that are designed as general IDEs for different tasks and languages, and there are others that are designed to work for a specific task or language. Any piece of software that is designed for task A, B, C, D, and E, will almost never be as good at task A as a piece of software designed specifically for task A. But the benefit is only have to install and use one thing. If having multiple IDEs isn’t an issue for you, then you broaden the scope of which ones you can choose from.\nHow free and open source is it?\nSoftware that is free to download is often a more attractive choice for obvious reasons, especially if you’re just trying it out.\nOpen source\nmeans the source code for the IDE is publicly available for anyone to view, use, modify, and share. This usually means more community support, and faster bug fixes.\nBut free to download doesn’t automatically mean open source. For example, VS Code is proprietary software released under the\nMicrosoft Software License\nbut it’s based on the MIT licensed program named\nVisual Studio Code – Open Source\n, also created by Microsoft.\nUsing software that is not open source means that it could cease to be available in the future which potentially has implications in terms of the reproducibility of your work.\nHow easy is it to find help?\nSome IDEs come with instructions or tips about where to find things when you first install (or update) it.
