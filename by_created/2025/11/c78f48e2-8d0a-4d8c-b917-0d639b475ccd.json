(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nAs we welcome the third cohort of the\nrOpenSci Champions Program\n, our second cohort has now completed the second phase of the program.\nIn this article, we share each Champion’s project, their achievements, and their outreach activities.\nChampions’ Projects\nIn their applications Champions choose to develop a new package or to participate in the review process as authors or reviewers.\nNew packages\nAndrea Gomez Vargas\n, from Argentina, developed the package\narcenso\n, to provide access to the official data of the national population censuses in Argentina from the National Institute of Statistics and Census – INDEC, and to make this historical census data available, homogenized, and ready to use. Her mentor was\nLuis Verde\nfrom Mexico. You can learn more about the package in\nthe blog post Andrea wrote about her project and her journey on the program\n.\nFrancesca Belem Lopes Palmeira\n, from Brazil, developed a new package called\npcir: ‘Potential for Conflict Index – PCI’\n, which is a descriptive statistical method used to enhance the understanding of outcomes in human dimensions research. The package equips users with the tools required for calculating, comparing, and graphing the potential for conflict. Her mentor was\nBruna Wundervald\nfrom Brazil.\nSunny Tseng\n, from Taiwan, now living in Canada, developed\nbbsTaiwan\n. This is an R package to streamline Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data retrieval and analysis. bbsTaiwan facilitates data access from GBIF, where Taiwan BBS data are stored. Users can tailor species analysis, controlling data stratification, preparation, and mapping. Sunny’s mentor was\nEunseop Kim\nfrom South Korea, now living in the USA.\nErika Siregar\n, from Indonesia, worked on developing\nrplaywright\nan R package seamlessly bridge with the NodeJS library, Playwright, enabling simplified web testing and automation for R users. This package aims to provide R users with a comprehensive toolkit for interacting with web browsers programmatically, allowing for tasks such as browser automation, web scraping, and end-to-end testing directly from within the R environment. Her mentor was\nApoor Anand\nfrom India.\nImproving and reviewing existing packages\nEzekiel Adebayo Ogundepo\nfrom Nigeria, worked on the\nbulkreadr\npackage, which is a package designed to optimize the process of importing and processing large datasets, providing compatibility with several file formats from a range of statistical software and spreadsheets. Ezekiel worked on enhanced functions functionality and launched the\nofficial website of the package\n. His mentor was\nFrancisco Cardozo\nfrom Colombia.\nLiz Hare\nfrom the US, worked as reviewer on the software peer review of the\nemodnet.wfs\npackage, that provides helpers to access EMODnet Web Feature Service data through R. Her mentor was\nFrançois Michonneau\nfrom France.\nSehrish Kanwal\n, from Australia, worked to improve the\nRNAsum R package\n, an RNA-seq reporting workflow designed to post-process, summarise, and visualize outputs. Sehrish worked on the package and a paper about it. The\npackage website\npresents more information on the package’s functionalities. Her mentor was\nEmi Tanaka\nfrom Australia.\nJacqui Levy\n, from Canada, worked on the\nicicle package\nto tidy and calculate ice cycle variables from thousands of open-source hydrological stations that are managed by the Water Survey of Canada. This R package will give scientists the tools to assess ice cycle variables and how they might be changing over time for any river station. Her mentor was\nJonathan Keane\n, from the US.\nBinod Jung Bogati\n, from Nepal, worked on the\nnepalcensus\npackage, which provides a comprehensive and up-to-date tool for accessing and exploring demographic, socio-economic, and geographic data collected during the most recent census conducted in Nepal. The package aims to facilitate data analysis and visualization for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding and utilizing census data effectively for various applications and insights. His mentor was\nErle Holgersen\nfrom Canada.\nOutreach Activities\nOur Champions carried out a wide range of outreach activities including talks, conference papers, workshops, blog articles, community calls and meetups. The objective of these activities was to share what they did and what they learned during the program with their communities beyond rOpenSci.\nOutreach activities commenced in August 2024, involved local communities (universities, RUGs, R-Ladies Chapters, conferences, and organizations), and were delivered in the Champions’ native/preferred languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese and Chinese).\nLiz Hare, member of this cohort worked together with Cagri, a champion from the first cohort to do outreach activities\nand also introduce their cohort mates to other communities and organizations giving them\nspace to share what they did during the Champions Program\n.\nVictor Ordu\n, first cohort champion, participated in the Unilorin meetup organized by Ezekiel, speaking about\nHands-On Data Cleaning in R with Regular Expressions\n.\nChampions worked with their local communities to organize different kinds of events and spaces:\nSunny organized a workshop to teach how to use the package she developed during the champions program in Taiwan.\nEzekiel submitted a proposal to the R Consortium to create the\nUnilorin R user Group\n, which received partial funding to get it started. After a successful year of operation, with 5 events held and more than 600 members, the group was awarded another R Consortium grant to continue its activities during 2025.\nAndrea organized several events in Argentina, including a talk at the\nR-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter and the RenBaires R user Group\nabout the arcenso package and the Champions Program.\nSehrish shared her experience on the rOpenSci Champions Program at the webinar\nChampioning omics data analysis through Open science, Mentoring and Innovating tool\nat the Australian National University.\nFrancesca organize a\nmeetup with R-Ladies Floripa to introduce her package pcir\nand\nshared the workshop materials openly\n.\nrOpenSci’s community spaces also benefited from the participation of the champions:\nSunny participated as a panelist in the community call\nFrom Novice to Contributor: Making and Supporting First-Time Contributions to FOSS\ntelling about her experience developing the\nbbsTawian\npackage as a project in the Champions Program.
