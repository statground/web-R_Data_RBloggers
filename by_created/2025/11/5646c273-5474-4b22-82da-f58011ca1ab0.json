You need to be able to figure out what your code does in a year’s time.</li>\n<li> Have a single directory for each project. Within that,  keep an R workspace, an R file containing the functions you’ve written, and one or more R files containing the code to read in the data, apply  the functions to the data, plot some graphs, etc.</li>\n<li> Don’t have multiple versions of essentially the same code. If you are doing similar things to what you’ve done before, write a  function to do it and call it when required.</li>\n<li>Have a <span style=\"font-family:Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;color:#000099\">main.R</span> file which does all the analysis for the paper,  chapter or report. It may simply consist of source lines such as</li>\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\"><span style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace\">source(”functions.R”)</span><br style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace\"/><span style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace\">source(”readdata.R”)</span><br style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace\"/><span style=\"font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace\">source(”fitmodel.R”)</span></div>\n<p>Then the whole project can be run by sourcing the main file.
