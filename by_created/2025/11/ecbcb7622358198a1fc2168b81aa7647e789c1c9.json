For traders that are analyzing vasts amount of data, it’s time you made the switch to the trader’s statistical package of choice.

Select a cell to compute the mean of a row and then select the elements of a column that you’d like to apply the formula to. When you have over 1,000 rows, it takes a while to drag that stupid mouse.
