The results are:Store A: 65, 48, 66, 75, 70, 55Store B: 64, 44, 70, 70, 68, 59Store C: 60, 50, 65, 69, 69, 57Store D: 62, 46, 68, 72, 67, 56 To proceed with the verification ANOVA, we must first verify the homoskedasticity (ie test for homogeneity of variances). The software R provides two tests: the Bartlett test, and the Fligner-Killeen test. We begin with the Bartlett test.First we create the 4 vectors:a = c(65, 48, 66, 75, 70, 55)b = c(64, 44, 70, 70, 68, 59)c = c(60, 50, 65, 69, 69, 57)d = c(62, 46, 68, 72, 67, 56) Now we combine the 4 vectors in a single vector:dati = c(a, b, c, d) Now, on this vector in which are stored all the data, we create the 4 levels:groups = factor(rep(letters[1:4], each = 6)) We can observe the contents of the vector groups simply by typing groups + [enter].At this point we start the Bartlett test:bartlett.test(dati, groups) Bartlett test of homogeneity of variancesdata: dati and groups Bartlett's K-squared = 0.4822, df = 3, p-value = 0.9228 The function gave us the value of the statistical tests (K squared), and the p-value. Can be argued that the variances are homogeneous since p-value > 0.05. Alternatively, we can compare the Bartlett's K-squared with the value of chi-square-tables; we compute that value, assigning the value of alpha and degrees of freedom at the qchisq function:qchisq(0.950, 3)[1] 7.814728 Chi-squared > Bartlett's K-squared: we accept the null hypothesis H0 (variances homogeneity) We try now to check the homoskedasticity, with the Fligner-Killeen test.The syntax is quite similar, and then proceed quickly.a = c(65, 48, 66, 75, 70, 55)b = c(64, 44, 70, 70, 68, 59)c = c(60, 50, 65, 69, 69, 57)d = c(62, 46, 68, 72, 67, 56)dati = c(a, b, c, d)groups = factor(rep(letters[1:4], each = 6))fligner.test(dati, groups) Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variancesdata: dati and groups Fligner-Killeen:med chi-squared = 0.1316, df = 3, p-value = 0.9878 The conclusions are similar to those for the test of Bartlett. Having verified the homoskedasticity of the 4 groups, we can proceed with the ANOVA model.First organize the values, fitting the model:fit = lm(formula = dati ~ groups) Then we analyze the ANOVA model:anova (fit)Analysis of Variance TableResponse: dati Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)groups 3 8.46 2.82 0.0327 0.9918Residuals 20 1726.50 86.33 The output of the function is a classical ANOVA table with the following data:Df = degree of freedomSum Sq = deviance (within groups, and residual)Mean Sq = variance (within groups, and residual)F value = the value of the Fisher statistic test, so computed (variance within groups) / (variance residual)Pr(>F) = p-valueSince p-value > 0.05, we accept the null hypothesis H0: the four means are statistically equal. We can also compare the computed F-value with the tabulated F-value:qf(0.950, 20, 3)[1] 8.66019 Tabulated F-value > computed F-value: we accept the null hyptohesis.",
