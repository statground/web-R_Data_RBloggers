INGARCH models provide an alternative.\nThe INGARCH models are implemented in the\ntscount R package\n. The best model family for count data is usually negative binomial. The INGARCH(1,1) model assumes that the overdispersion parameter $\\phi$ is fixed, and the mean $\\lambda$ follows a process of the form\n\\[\\lambda_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Y_{t-1} + \\alpha_1 \\lambda_{t-1}\\]\nfor some $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\alpha_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe following R code can be used to fit the model to increasingly-long initial segements of the time series and predict the length of the next conclave in the sequence.\nconclave <- read.csv(\"conclave_data.csv\")\n\ntsglm_models <- list()\nfor (i in 10:length(z)){\n  tsglm_models[[i]] <- tsglm(ts=ts(conclave$n_days[1:i]), model=list(past_obs=1, past_mean=1), distr=\"nbinom\", link=\"identity\")\n}\ntsglm_models <- tsglm_models[!sapply(tsglm_models, is.null)]\n\npredict_next_value <- function(model){\n  pred <- predict(model, 1)\n  CI <- pred$interval\n}\n\n# 95% intervals (the default)\nCIs <- lapply(tsglm_models[!is.null(tsglm_models)], predict_next_value)\nI have plotted the results on a log scale because some of the intervals are extremely wide. (Note that a lower bound of zero doesn’t make sense on a log scale so I have left it off.)\nThe 95% prediction interval for the length in days of the 2025 conclave is $[0, 22]$ and the prediction for the next conclave (whenever that occurs) is $[0, 17]$.\nGARCH model\nIf you take the log of the conclave lengths (as in the previous plot) and plot the differences, you get the following plot\nEven though this is quite a short time series, it’s clear that the variance is not constant. The natural model for this sort of situation is the GARCH model.\nYou can fit a GARCH(1,1) model to the “log returns” of the series of conclave lengths by using the following R code.\nlibrary(fGarch)\nz <- diff(log(conclave$n_days))\n\ngarch_models <- list()\nfor (i in 10:length(z)){\n  garch_models[[i+1]] <- garchFit(~1+garch(1,1),data=z[1:i],trace=F)\n}\ngarch_models <- garch_models[!sapply(garch_models, is.null)]\n\npredict_next_value <- function(model){\n  pred <- predict(model, n.ahead=1)\n  CI <- pred$meanForecast + 1.96 * pred$standardDeviation * c(-1, 1)\n}\n\n# confidence interval for the next value of z\nCI_z <- lapply(garch_models[!is.null(garch_models)], predict_next_value)\n\n# confidence interval for the next value of n_days\nCI_garch <- sapply(CI_z, exp) * matrix(rep(conclave$n_days[11:64], 2), nrow=2, byrow=T)\nFrom the plot below, it’s clear that the GARCH predictions are much more sensitive to recent events than the INGARCH predictions. Nevertheless, the whole point of GARCH is that the model also takes into account the fact that periods of high variance have occurred in the past.\nThe 95% prediction interval for the length in days of the 2025 conclave is $[0.1, 5.1]$ and the prediction for the next conclave is $[0.1, 4.4]$.\nThe following plot compares the two models. On a log scale, there’s not much to choose between them. Personally, I think I prefer the GARCH model. After all, the data isn’t really discrete. The fact that it’s count data is just an artefact of rounding to the nearest day.\nConclusion\nEven though “there’s no way to predict how long a conclave will take”, some crude time series analysis suggests that the next conclave can be expected to take between 0 and 5 days (or 0 and 17 days if you preferred the INGARCH model). When will it happen? From the\nSignificance\narticle, probably 10-20 years in the future.\nAnd, of course, the density of popes in Vatican City is likely to remain steady at just over five popes per square mile!\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\ndatascienceconfidential - r\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
