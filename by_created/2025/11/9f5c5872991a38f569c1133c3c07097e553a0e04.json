People can choose (or not) to learn English at any time, but having first learned how to, say, develop software using French isn’t going to impede that.\nOur goal is for people to be able to use and contribute to open-source tools, and this shouldn’t be dependent on them speaking English. In science, not being a native English speaker is already hard enough and there is an large amount of “untapped potential of non-native English speakers”<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/06/23/translation-faq/#fn:1\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></sup>. Let’s release this potential!</p>\n<h3>\nRelated: Is it that hard to read in English?\n</h3><p>Yes, it is one of the “manifold costs of being a non-native English speaker in science”<sup id=\"fnref1:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/06/23/translation-faq/#fn:1\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">1</a></sup>.\nFurther, there are several studies which have demonstrated the difficulties of learning to code in English-based programming languages when you are not an English speaker, and the benefits of having opportunities to learn in your native language.</p>\n<p>Gou<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/06/23/translation-faq/#fn:2\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">2</a></sup> found that non-native English speakers faced barriers with reading instructional materials, technical communication, reading and writing code, and simultaneously learning English and programming.\nThese difficulties are rooted in the need to develop English understanding <em>at the same time</em> that they are expected to learn about the specific topic: in our case, how to develop research open source high quality software.\nIf you’ve ever tried to learn both statistics and R at the same time, you may have an idea of how hard this can be. This kind of dual learning increases cognitive load, which can hinder learning<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/06/23/translation-faq/#fn:3\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Another study<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/06/23/translation-faq/#fn:4\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">4</a></sup> suggested that while learning to program in English isn’t necessarily difficult for all non-English speakers, including students’ native language can make the learning experience clearer, more supportive and more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about this topic we suggest you follow <a href=\"https://www.felienne.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Felienne Hermans</a>, who specializes in programming language design and developed a multilingual programming language for teaching.</p>\n<h3>\nRelated: People should learn English\n</h3><p>Some people claim that you have to learn English if you want to work in programming and science because English is the lingua franca of these disciplines.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even if this were desirable, this is simply not possible for many people, especially for casual or end-user programmers. They might not have the time, energy or money to learn both programming and English at the same time<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/06/23/translation-faq/#fn:5\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">5</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Let’s do some numbers: <a href=\"https://www.languagecert.org/en/guided-learning-hours\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages</a> has tabulated the guided learning hours typically required to reach each language proficiency level. These are hours spent studying with a teacher or through structured learning.</p>\n<p>For example, if you start as a beginner (A1) and want to become intermediate (B1) you will need approximately <strong>400 guided hours</strong>. If you can dedicate <strong>5 hours a week</strong>, it will take <strong>1.5 years</strong> and a minimum budget of <strong>USD $6,000</strong> to learn English. For reference, this would be the equivalent of two years of salary for a person with a minimum wage in Argentina. This also does not take into account the cost of finding the time to study (child minding services, working fewer hours, etc.).</p>\n<p>By translating documents and resources we reduce the burden on non-English speakers. The more people involved in open source software and science, the more benefit we all get from bigger pool of experiences and expertise.\nFinally, we want everyone to have the same opportunity to enjoy learning!</p>\n<h2>\nWhy don’t you rely on automatic translations only?\n</h2><p>For our <a href=\"https://translationguide.ropensci.org/intro.html#general-aspects-of-the-stage-1-of-the-translation-process\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">translation workflows</a>, machine translations are the first step followed by human reviews.\nWhile you can publish automatic translations directly, or use tools for on-the-fly translations, there are drawbacks.\nFirst, it is well documented that machine translation does not work well for less common languages<sup id=\"fnref1:5\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/06/23/translation-faq/#fn:5\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-noteref\" target=\"_blank\">5</a></sup>.\nEven for common languages, automatic translations still have errors, and struggle with meanings related to context, grammar and syntax, as well as gender marks.\nMachine translation also can’t localize some content, such as meaningful idioms, or currency and numeric symbols.</p>\n<p>If we rely solely on automatic translation, the content in translated languages will be of poorer quality, so it would mean accepting that users in semi-supported languages do not deserve the same quality as others.\nTherefore at rOpenSci, human translators are involved in the process to ensure that all of our content is of good quality regardless of language.</p>\n<h2>\nWhy don’t you use <code>&lt;insert-name-of-translation-platform&gt;</code> instead of Git and GitHub?\n</h2><p>There are many different platforms for translation, which is fantastic!\nHowever, we are a technical community and we are translating and localizing technical content.\nWe are already using Git and GitHub in our other development workflows and many of our community members know these tools or are planning to learn them.\nFor members who are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, we have resources and are happy to help them learn, and then they have new tools which they can apply to other technical projects.\nRead more about our tooling and processes in our <a href=\"https://translationguide.ropensci.org/intro.html#technical-infrastructure-and-workflows\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">translation guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>\nIsn’t translation and the maintenance of translations a lot of work?\n</h2><p>Yes it is!\nBut we think it’s worth it.\nFurthermore, translation work brings new contributors to the community, which a) helps share the load, b) serves as a springboard to other forms of contributions, and c) makes our community more diverse 🎉.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion\n</h2><p>In this post we answered common questions we receive about our multilingual publishing project.\nWe are convinced that providing quality multilingual resources is part of fostering more <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/02/05/no-science-without-deia/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility</a> in open source and open science.\nWe welcome your participation… and even more questions!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Amano T, Ramírez-Castañeda V, Berdejo-Espinola V, Borokini I, Chowdhury S, Golivets M, et al.

      "main_text": "Multilingual Publishing: Frequently Asked Questions\nPosted on\nJune 22, 2025\nby\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nRead it in: Español\n.\nRead it in: Français\n.\nAs we’ve\nsaid before\n, we believe that publishing multilingual resources can lower the barrier to access to knowledge, help democratize access to quality resources and increase the possibilities of contributing to software and open science projects.\nOur ongoing efforts at\nmultilingual publishing\nare crucial work for rOpenSci’s\nmission\n.\nWhen discussing this project at\nconferences\nand\nelsewhere\n, we start an important conversation with people less familiar with such projects or unfamiliar with our specific\nworkflows\n.\nIn this post, we summarize frequently asked questions, and our best answers to them (even better formulated than in the heat of a post-talk Q&A session 😁).\nWill translations make people “lazy” in that they won’t learn English?\nFirst of all, it’s important to be clear that\nnot\nlearning English doesn’t mean people are lazy.\nMany people who do not speak English already speak several languages, and even if they only speak one, working on one’s project with the tools at one’s disposal is already work enough.\nSecond, our goal is not for people to become English speakers. People can choose (or not) to learn English at any time, but having first learned how to, say, develop software using French isn’t going to impede that.\nOur goal is for people to be able to use and contribute to open-source tools, and this shouldn’t be dependent on them speaking English. In science, not being a native English speaker is already hard enough and there is an large amount of “untapped potential of non-native English speakers”\n1\n. Let’s release this potential!\nRelated: Is it that hard to read in English?\nYes, it is one of the “manifold costs of being a non-native English speaker in science”\n1\n.\nFurther, there are several studies which have demonstrated the difficulties of learning to code in English-based programming languages when you are not an English speaker, and the benefits of having opportunities to learn in your native language.\nGou\n2\nfound that non-native English speakers faced barriers with reading instructional materials, technical communication, reading and writing code, and simultaneously learning English and programming.\nThese difficulties are rooted in the need to develop English understanding\nat the same time\nthat they are expected to learn about the specific topic: in our case, how to develop research open source high quality software.\nIf you’ve ever tried to learn both statistics and R at the same time, you may have an idea of how hard this can be. This kind of dual learning increases cognitive load, which can hinder learning\n3\n.\nAnother study\n4\nsuggested that while learning to program in English isn’t necessarily difficult for all non-English speakers, including students’ native language can make the learning experience clearer, more supportive and more enjoyable.\nIf you are interested in learning more about this topic we suggest you follow\nFelienne Hermans\n, who specializes in programming language design and developed a multilingual programming language for teaching.\nRelated: People should learn English\nSome people claim that you have to learn English if you want to work in programming and science because English is the lingua franca of these disciplines.\nUnfortunately, even if this were desirable, this is simply not possible for many people, especially for casual or end-user programmers. They might not have the time, energy or money to learn both programming and English at the same time\n5\n.\nLet’s do some numbers:\nThe Common European Framework of Reference for Languages\nhas tabulated the guided learning hours typically required to reach each language proficiency level. These are hours spent studying with a teacher or through structured learning.\nFor example, if you start as a beginner (A1) and want to become intermediate (B1) you will need approximately\n400 guided hours\n. If you can dedicate\n5 hours a week\n, it will take\n1.5 years\nand a minimum budget of\nUSD $6,000\nto learn English. For reference, this would be the equivalent of two years of salary for a person with a minimum wage in Argentina. This also does not take into account the cost of finding the time to study (child minding services, working fewer hours, etc.).\nBy translating documents and resources we reduce the burden on non-English speakers. The more people involved in open source software and science, the more benefit we all get from bigger pool of experiences and expertise.\nFinally, we want everyone to have the same opportunity to enjoy learning!\nWhy don’t you rely on automatic translations only?\nFor our\ntranslation workflows\n, machine translations are the first step followed by human reviews.\nWhile you can publish automatic translations directly, or use tools for on-the-fly translations, there are drawbacks.\nFirst, it is well documented that machine translation does not work well for less common languages\n5\n.\nEven for common languages, automatic translations still have errors, and struggle with meanings related to context, grammar and syntax, as well as gender marks.\nMachine translation also can’t localize some content, such as meaningful idioms, or currency and numeric symbols.\nIf we rely solely on automatic translation, the content in translated languages will be of poorer quality, so it would mean accepting that users in semi-supported languages do not deserve the same quality as others.\nTherefore at rOpenSci, human translators are involved in the process to ensure that all of our content is of good quality regardless of language.\nWhy don’t you use\n<insert-name-of-translation-platform>\ninstead of Git and GitHub?\nThere are many different platforms for translation, which is fantastic!\nHowever, we are a technical community and we are translating and localizing technical content.\nWe are already using Git and GitHub in our other development workflows and many of our community members know these tools or are planning to learn them.\nFor members who are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, we have resources and are happy to help them learn, and then they have new tools which they can apply to other technical projects.\nRead more about our tooling and processes in our\ntranslation guide\n.\nIsn’t translation and the maintenance of translations a lot of work?\nYes it is!\nBut we think it’s worth it.\nFurthermore, translation work brings new contributors to the community, which a) helps share the load, b) serves as a springboard to other forms of contributions, and c) makes our community more diverse 🎉.\nConclusion\nIn this post we answered common questions we receive about our multilingual publishing project.\nWe are convinced that providing quality multilingual resources is part of fostering more\ndiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\nin open source and open science.\nWe welcome your participation… and even more questions!\nAmano T, Ramírez-Castañeda V, Berdejo-Espinola V, Borokini I, Chowdhury S, Golivets M, et al.
