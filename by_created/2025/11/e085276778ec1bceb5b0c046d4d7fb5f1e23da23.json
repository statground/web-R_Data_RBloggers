Trying ?dummy didn’t turn up anything.  Surely some else must have encountered this and provided a package.   I went to the Internet and sure enough the <a href=\"http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=tips:data-manip:create_indicator\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">R-wiki</a> was here to save me.  And looking even harder, I found some who had treaded before me on the R-Help archives.  It turns out, it’s simple.  Expanding a variable as a dummy variable can be done like so:</p>\n<p><code>\n\nx &lt;- c(2, 2, 5, 3, 6, 5, NA)\n\nxf &lt;- factor(x, levels = 2:6)\n\nmodel.matrix( ~ xf - 1)\n\n</code></p>\n<p>Two problems.  The first problem is that without an external source (Google), I would have never stumbled upon what I wanted.  ( Thanks Google!)  I understand it now, but for what I wanted to do, I would never have thought, “oh, model.matrix.”</p>\n<p>The second problem is the arcane syntax, <code>wtf &lt;- ~ xf - 1</code>.  I get it now, but it took me some time to figure out what was going on.  I get it, but why not just <code>dummy(var)</code>?  This is what I want to do.</p>\n<p>The solution on the wiki wasn’t quite what I was looking for.  For instance, you can’t say:</p>\n<p><code>model.matrix( ~ xf1 + xf2 + xf3- 1)</code></p>\n<p>It turns out, you can only expand one variable at a time.  Well, this is not good.  I know that you could solve this with some sapply’s and some tests, but next time I might forgot about how to do it.  So with a couple of spare hours, I decided that the next guy, wouldn’t have to think about it.  He could just use my <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dummies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dummies package</a>.</p>\n<p>Like the R-wiki solution, the dummies package provides a nice interface for encoding a single variable.  You can pass a variable -or- a variable name with a data frame.  These are equivalent:</p>\n<p><code>\n\ndummy( df$var )\n\ndummy( \"var\", df )\n\n</code></p>\n<p>Moreover, you can choose the style of the dummy names, whether to include unused factor level, to have verbose output, etc.</p>\n<p>But more than the R-wiki solution, dummy.data.frame offers to something similar to data.frames.
