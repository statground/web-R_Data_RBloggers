And it too has recently undergone a minor upgrade to allow you to write less and less boring code while keeping a top-notch check! (see our article\n{attachment} v0.4.0 : Major changes and a configuration file for a better experience\n)\nGoing further with {checkhelper}\nYou can find {checkhelper}\non CRAN\nand\non GitHub for its development version\nTo read the full documentation for the {checkhelper} package, you can follow\nthis link to the {pkgdown} site\n.\nOther features are in the pipeline for {checkhelper}, such as the ability to produce a “code coverage” at the same time as the “check”, without running the tests twice, in order to reduce the calculation time which is sometimes very long for large packages. If you would like to take part in these developments by reporting bugs or submitting pull requests, please visit the {checkhelper} github page (\nhttps://github.com/ThinkR-open/checkhelper/\n).\nCheck out our other\ncontributions to open-source and the R community here\nThis post is better presented on its original ThinkR website here:\n{checkhelper} is on CRAN: so you don’t have to be afraid to run a check\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nRtask\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
