I will organise my\ncomments by pointing out three <em>epic fails</em>.\n<p>\n\nFirst, of course, was the Chicago weather.  After two successive marathon in\nexcessive heat — the\n<a href=\"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2007/10/09#chicago_marathon_2007\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2007 race I completed, poorly,</a>\nwith its thousands of runners forced to abandon when the race was cancelled\ndue to excessive heat, and the 2008 version which I skipped as I\n<a href=\"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2008/10/01#berlin_marathon_2008\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ran\nBerlin that year just weeks before Chicago</a>,\nthis year had forecasts of temperatures in the thirties and possibly snow the\nnight before.  Well, the weather cleared up — but with those clear skies we\nstill got a severe weather alert for the area due to frost!  So at the (now\nearlier by 30 minutes) race start, it was very nippy and in the higher 30s,\nimproving steadily under sunny skies.  Overall, a little chilly and hence not\nexactly ideal, but not too bad in the grand scheme of things.  A little windy\ncoming up Michigan Avenue.  But hey,\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/sports/12marathon.html?ref=sports\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Wanjiru still finished with a course record</a>\nthough still well off the world record.  So maybe not a fail after all. \n\n<p>\n\nThe second fail, though, was my GPS which I had just\n<a href=\"http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2009/10/10#r_for_systems_administration\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blogged\nabout yesterday</a> (albeit indirectly).  I had had my issues with the previous\n(much simpler and older) Forerunner 205 which lost satellite tracking when\nrunning downtown amidst the skyscrapers. I had high hopes that this newer model\nwould do better.  But no, not only did it loose track within the first few\nmiles, it even managed to outdo the older model by turning its GPS tracking off\nin the later stages.  Now that’s a fail!\n\n<p>\n\nThe third and final fail, unfortunately, concerns my run.  Training had gone\nwell enough to let me hope for another decent race. However, a latent cold\nduring the last two weeks had left me somewhat afraid I might not do well.\nThings felt better yesterday, and I ended up running a decent first eighteen\nmiles to the waterstop the rest of my household was working.  And thereafter:\nwell let’s just say that the wheels came off.  I ended up with a 3:25:40 (or\naround 7:51 min/mile and 4:53 min/km) which is not terrible but also not one\nof my better races.\n\n<p>\n\nI updated the two race data geekery charts shown here before to illustrate the <em>fail</em>.\nAs I am running out of shades of blue for Chicago, I show the 2009 race in\npurple.  A decent, flat chat indicating a reasonably steady pace throughout most\nof the race … followed by one of the very worst finished.
