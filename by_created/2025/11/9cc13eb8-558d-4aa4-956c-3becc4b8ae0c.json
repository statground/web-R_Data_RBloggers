For example, if an investment compounds at annual interest rate of 9%, then the investment will double in approximately 72/9 = 8 years.

Function 2 is the equation of the tangent line to function 1 at x = .05.  (To derive the tangent line, recall from calculus that if y = LN(1 + x), then dy/dx = 1/(1 + x) ). The plot on the right is of the same two functions, but with the x range shrunk to (0.0, 0.1).  In this small range the two functions are indistinguishable.

But for those of who are not doing something where great precision is required, linearity may be just fine,\nHere is the R-code to plot the graphs.  Note that in R, log(x) is the natural log function.  This is also true in Python and Excel.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncommon_theme <- theme(\n     legend.position=\"right\",\n     plot.title = element_text(size=15, face=\"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12.5, face=\"bold\"),\n     axis.title = element_text(size=15, face=\"bold\"),\n     axis.text = element_text(size=15, face=\"bold\"),\n     axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0),\n     legend.title = element_text(size=15, face=\"bold\"),\n     legend.text = element_text(size=15, face=\"bold\"))\n\na <- 0.0\nb <- 1.0\nx_values <- seq(a, b, by = 0.01)\nfunc1 <- function(x) {log(1 + x)}\nfunc2 <- function(x) {log(1.05) + (1/1.05)*(x - .05)}\ndf1 <- data.frame(x = x_values,\n           y = log(1 +x_values),\n           func = \"Function 1\")\ndf2 <- data.frame(x = x_values,\n           y = log(1.05) + (1/1.05)*(x_values - .05),\n           func = \"Function 2\")\ncombined_df <- rbind(df1, df2)\n\nggplot(combined_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = func)) +\n   geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n   scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Function 1\" = \"#E41A1C\", \n            \"Function 2\" = \"royalblue4\")) +\n   ylim(c(0, 1)) + \n   labs(title = \"Plot of LN and Linear Functions\",\n              x = \"x\",\n              y = \"y\",\n              color = \"Functions\") +\n  common_theme\n\nggplot(combined_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = func)) +\n   geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n   scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Function 1\" = \"#E41A1C\", \n            \"Function 2\" = \"royalblue4\")) +\n   xlim(c(0, 0.1)) +\n   ylim(c(0, 0.11)) + \n   labs(title = \"Plot of LN Function and its Tangent Line at x = .05\",\n              x = \"x\",\n              y = \"y\",\n              color = \"Functions\") +\n  common_theme\nEnd\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nOnline College Math Teacher\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
