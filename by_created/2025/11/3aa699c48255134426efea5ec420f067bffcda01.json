You’re not alone. We’ve all been there, clicking through multiple options, often unsure of what to choose. Not to mention, their placement is often inconsistent across different sites, which makes it hard to get accustomed to a single UX design choice.</p>\n<p>Enter <b>Human Readable Filters</b>. Put simply, they’re here not to fully replace traditional filtering options, but to significantly simplify interaction and enhance the user experience. In other words, they allow you to <b>replace confusing dropdowns with simple and clear sentences</b> that you can adjust as easily as you speak.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do people struggle to get used to your app? <a href=\"https://appsilon.com/ux-design-of-shiny-apps-7-steps-to-design-dashboards-people-love/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Here are 7 steps to design R Shiny dashboards that people will love</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://appsilon.com/human-readable-filters/#problem\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">What’s Wrong with Traditional Website Filters?</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://appsilon.com/human-readable-filters/#solution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Human Readable Filters – A Solution That Speaks to You in Your Language</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://appsilon.com/human-readable-filters/#benefits\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">More Advantages of Filters in a Natural Language</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://appsilon.com/human-readable-filters/#summary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Summing up Human Readable Filters</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"problem\">What’s Wrong with Traditional Website Filters?</h2>\n<p>Just to reiterate once more – Human Readable Filters aren’t here to fully replace traditional filters. They are still valuable, but getting less so by the day.</p>\n<p><b>The reason?</b> We have a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Complexity: </b>The problem with traditional search filters is that they’re often intricate and have numerous options and categories to choose from. As an end-user, you might find it challenging to find the information you need, especially if it’s your first time visiting the website.</li>\n<li><b>Placement: </b>The position of website filters depends on their quantity and variability, but you’ll mostly find them positioned either on the sides or at the top of the screen. The problem with that is they consume a significant portion of the website’s content. Designers and developers often address this by hiding filters behind buttons or in sliding panels, but this only complicates their accessibility and interaction. If you need to tweak the filters frequently, it’s an even bigger issue!</li>\n<li><b>Lack of consistency: </b>The problem with websites is that everyone thinks their UI/UX implementation is the best.

In return, this provides flexibility and extensive possibilities for combining conditions.</li>\n<li><b>Increased Engagement: </b>Natural text is intuitive so it contributes to increased user engagement. It also encourages users to explore the data on their own and discover new opportunities.</li>\n<li><b>Competitive Advantage: </b>If your organization is among the first to implement Filters 2.0, it will gain a competitive edge by being among the pioneers of simplifying and enhancing the search process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today’s article was crammed with information and examples, but we hope it was easy enough to follow.

      "main_text": "Goodbye Complicated Dropdowns: Welcome to the New Era of Human Readable Filters\nPosted on\nJanuary 9, 2024\nby\nYuri Pribysh\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nTag: r - Appsilon | Enterprise R Shiny Dashboards\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nHave you ever tried to book a flight and found yourself overwhelmed by the endless dropdown menus? You’re not alone. We’ve all been there, clicking through multiple options, often unsure of what to choose. Not to mention, their placement is often inconsistent across different sites, which makes it hard to get accustomed to a single UX design choice.\nEnter\nHuman Readable Filters\n. Put simply, they’re here not to fully replace traditional filtering options, but to significantly simplify interaction and enhance the user experience. In other words, they allow you to\nreplace confusing dropdowns with simple and clear sentences\nthat you can adjust as easily as you speak.\nDo people struggle to get used to your app?\nHere are 7 steps to design R Shiny dashboards that people will love\n.\nTable of Contents\nWhat’s Wrong with Traditional Website Filters?\nHuman Readable Filters – A Solution That Speaks to You in Your Language\nMore Advantages of Filters in a Natural Language\nSumming up Human Readable Filters\nWhat’s Wrong with Traditional Website Filters?\nJust to reiterate once more – Human Readable Filters aren’t here to fully replace traditional filters. They are still valuable, but getting less so by the day.\nThe reason?\nWe have a few:\nComplexity:\nThe problem with traditional search filters is that they’re often intricate and have numerous options and categories to choose from. As an end-user, you might find it challenging to find the information you need, especially if it’s your first time visiting the website.\nPlacement:\nThe position of website filters depends on their quantity and variability, but you’ll mostly find them positioned either on the sides or at the top of the screen. The problem with that is they consume a significant portion of the website’s content. Designers and developers often address this by hiding filters behind buttons or in sliding panels, but this only complicates their accessibility and interaction. If you need to tweak the filters frequently, it’s an even bigger issue!\nLack of consistency:\nThe problem with websites is that everyone thinks their UI/UX implementation is the best. It isn’t. Traditional search filters often don’t have a consistent or standardized appearance between applications and websites. For you as an end-user, this means an extra step in understanding where to find the filter parameters and how to use them.\nIn short, all of these 3 issues have a common denominator:\nthe time users invest in the search process\n.\nEveryone knows that the best user experience can be represented as the shortest route from point A to point B, as shown in the following image:\nImage 1 – Suboptimal (top) and optimal (bottom) user experience\nBut still, most websites fail to implement this “straight line” user experience. Poorly designed filters represent a big portion of the top curvy line, so next, we’ll explore what you can do about it.\nHuman Readable Filters – A Solution That Speaks to You in Your Language\nBy now, you know the shortcomings of traditional filtering systems on websites, and this section will introduce you to\nFilters 2.0\n, or Human Readable Filters.\nIf you skim through Jacob Nielsen’s\n10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design\n, you’ll find that the second principle tells us that the\nsystem should “speak” to the user in their language\n. That’s the main idea behind Human Readable Filters.\nIn a conversational language, a “search query” would be a single sentence with a set of specific conditionals. Typically, this is a logical sequence arranged by priority. This single sentence should be sufficient to convey the user’s position to the listener.\nSo, what does this mean to you?\nPut simply, you arrive at the idea of wrapping the query system into a single human-readable sentence, like the one below:\nImage 2 – Human readable filter example\nEach blue and underlined piece of text is interactive and opens up a filter dialog when clicked (or pressed) on.\nLet’s dive into the anatomy to really drive the point home.\nAnatomy of Human Readable Filters\nEvery Filter 2.0 starts with a\nCall to action\n. You can think of it as the beginning of the sentence that helps to form a query, similar to real-life conversations.\nIn the example below, the call to action is the free state at the beginning of the sentence:\nImage 3 – Call to action\nUp next, we have one or more\nConditions\n. These are 1:1 replicas of your familiar filters, just represented in a sentence. Clicking on each reveals a set of options every condition might have.\nYou can represent conditionals with a single select, multi-select, search bar (in a single or multi-select), date/time picker, range, counter, and so on:\nImage 4 – Condition\nThen you have prepositions which aren’t dynamic at all, but are used simply to link conditions. Think of the words such as\nAny, Of, At, All, By, For, In, With, To, Since, Until\n, and similar:\nImage 5 – Preposition\nThese are the must-have components of Human Readable Filters. If you’re wondering how they look in a\nreal-world example\n, continue reading.\nHuman Readable Filters Example – Flight Aggregator\nImagine your typical flight aggregator page. You typically need to enter information such as from and to destination, departure date and time, return date and time, passenger class, and the number of people for which you want to buy a ticket.\nIn a traditional (Filter 1.0) world, that webpage system could look like this:\nImage 6 – Flight aggregator example without human readable filters\nIt looks fine on a desktop version of the site, but the mobile version might hide these filters behind a button or somewhere else on the page.\nHuman Readable Filters (Filters 2.0) exchange all of that for a\nsimple natural language text\nthat can be modified:\nImage 7 – Flight aggregator example with human readable filters\nHere, you see everything we described in the previous section – call to action, conditions, and prepositions.\nThe first condition requires you to\nspecify who is flying\n. You can select the number of passengers based on their age group, as shown below:\nImage 8 – Single filter example (1)\nImmediately after you select your option, the natural text of the condition will change to form a fluent and short sentence.\nThe preposition\nto\nconnects us to the next filter which is a date/time picker. This one will\nspecify when are you flying\n:\nImage 9 – Single filter example (2)\nAfter the following preposition, we arrive at the double single select with the search bar condition. This one will make you\nspecify where you are flying\nin a simple and convenient way. Note that you might want to separate\nFrom\nand\nTo\ninto two filters, or you can leave them as is:\nImage 10 – Single filter example (3)\nAlmost done! The second to last condition is the simplest one so far – you only need to\nchoose the class\nfor your flight:\nImage 11 – Single filter example (4)\nThe final condition lets you increase or decrease the amount of luggage you’re taking with you, which is an additional and\noptional filter\n:\nImage 12 – Single filter example (5)\nFrom here, you can either press the\ngreen arrow\nbutton to display the available flight options, or you can click on the\nred circle\nto reset the filters, and bring the sentence to its initial state.\nLet’s say you opt for the first option. The frontend will then communicate with the backend to fetch results based on your search criteria, and during this time you’re shown a nice skeleton loading screen (which has nothing to do with Human Readable Filters):\nImage 13 – Final results\nTo conclude,\nHuman Readable Filters allow you to implement everything the traditional approach has to offer\n, but with a nicer and more consistent user experience.\nRemember This Before Using Human Readable Filters\nIf you need more practical examples, this video shows you how it’s done on a real dataset:\nhttps://wordpress.appsilon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Recording-2023-03-17-at-14.05.48.webm\nTo finish off this section, you need to remember that you\nalways must have your end user in mind\n.\nYou should construct a sentence as long as it makes sense, or as long as it follows a natural structure. That’s the entire purpose of this refined approach to filtering.\nAlso, remember that the key to successfully implementing Filters 2.0 in your webpage lies in a good understanding of your user. This will allow you to build a sentence structure that’s easy for your target user to follow.\nMore Advantages of Filters in a Natural Language\nYou’ve seen what a huge milestone Filters 2.0 is when compared to traditional filtering systems – both in theory and through hands-on examples.\nThis section aims to provide a couple of more reasons why natural language in search results filtering is the way to go in 2024 and beyond:\nSimplicity and Accessibility:\nNatural language filters reduce interaction complexity and make the search process intuitive, accessible, and even fun to all kinds of users – even those who aren’t tech-savvy.\nEfficiency and Speed:\nA single natural language string means the users can quickly express their preferences without the need to learn a multitude of complex filters, which in the end improves efficiency and reduces search time.\nFlexibility and Variability:\nThe Filters 2.0 approach allows users to dynamically change the applied filters during query formulation. In return, this provides flexibility and extensive possibilities for combining conditions.\nIncreased Engagement:\nNatural text is intuitive so it contributes to increased user engagement. It also encourages users to explore the data on their own and discover new opportunities.\nCompetitive Advantage:\nIf your organization is among the first to implement Filters 2.0, it will gain a competitive edge by being among the pioneers of simplifying and enhancing the search process.\nToday’s article was crammed with information and examples, but we hope it was easy enough to follow. Let’s make a quick recap next.\nSumming up Human Readable Filters\nTo sum things up – the entire point of Filters 2.0 isn’t only to fix the problems we had, but also to set a stage for making websites and applications better for users, supercharging efficiency, and giving us a leg up against the competition.\nThat’s why we’ll share two interesting resources with you:\nHuman Readable Fitlers in Action\n– A simple Shiny application (with code) that allows you to visualize the difference between traditional filters and Filters 2.0.\nAppsilon Natural Language Queries GitHub Repo\n– So you can download the source code and take it for a spin.\nAs a final note, Filters 2.0 isn’t just about solving issues, but more generally about updating our whole vibe and making things awesome for the users, all while staying ahead in the game.\nMake sure to try them out for yourself, and let us know what you think.\nDid you find this helpful?\nContact us today to explore how we can upgrade the user experience of your Shiny apps.\nThe post appeared first on appsilon.com/blog/.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nTag: r - Appsilon | Enterprise R Shiny Dashboards\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
