The sales team loves it. Next month, they’ll need it again. And the month after that. Sound familiar?</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s a better way:</strong> A data scientist and a sales manager sit down for three hours. They describe what they need, let an LLM generate <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/r-quarto-tutorial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Quarto</a> code, iterate on the suggestions, refine the approach, and deploy. Each iteration gets them closer to exactly what they want – sometimes by improving the prompts, sometimes by tweaking the code. The result? The same report, running automatically every month on <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/deploying-to-rstudio-connect\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Posit Connect</a>, always with fresh data. No more manual updates, no more waiting for the data team’s bandwidth.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Want to create Quarto reports in VS Code? <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/quarto-python-and-vscode\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Learn how to integrate Quarto with Python for seamless reporting.</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>But let’s be clear – this isn’t about replacing data scientists with AI. It’s about eliminating repetitive work and bridging the gap between teams. LLMs excel at generating boilerplate <a href=\"https://quarto.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Quarto</a> code and suggesting visualizations, while your technical team ensures the output is correct and maintainable. Think of it as pair programming, where one partner types incredibly fast but needs a code review for every commit.</p>\n<p>This approach isn’t limited to sales reports. At Appsilon, we’ve seen marketing teams automate their cross-platform analytics, converting hours of manual data gathering into automated weekly insights. The key? Combining LLM-powered rapid development with proper technical validation and <a href=\"https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Posit Connect</a>‘s automation capabilities.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Want to add AI to your Shiny for Python apps? <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/llm-apps-shiny-python\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Learn how to integrate LLMs effectively with practical insights from our latest guide.</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2>The Reality of LLM-Assisted Development</h2>\n<p>Working with LLMs on Quarto reports means having access to an encyclopedic knowledge of visualization techniques and data presentation patterns. Whether you need summary statistics, trend analysis, or performance metrics, LLMs can suggest effective ways to present your data and handle the complexities of data transformations.</p>\n<p>The development process transforms into a dynamic conversation. Business teams can watch their ideas take shape in real-time, with no lengthy requirement documents or back-and-forth emails. Your team can rapidly prototype different approaches: “Show me a funnel chart for conversion rates.” “Now add cohort analysis.” “Let’s try a heatmap instead.” Each iteration takes seconds instead of minutes.</p>\n<p>The key lies in understanding how to refine LLM suggestions. While they occasionally mix up parameter names or suggest deprecated functions, your technical team knows exactly how to spot and fix these issues. Additionally each generation of models gets better and cheaper so this workflow will only get better and easier. This combination of rapid prototyping and technical validation turns what used to be hours of repetitive weekly work into a one-time development session, resulting in an automated solution that runs reliably week after week.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Managing a remote data science team? <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/rstudio-connect-as-a-solution-for-remote-data-science-teams\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">See why Posit Connect is the perfect platform for collaboration and deployment.</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2>The Power of Automation</h2>\n<p>This is where Quarto and Posit Connect transform a one-off script into a sustainable solution. Once your report is ready and validated, deploying it to Posit Connect means it can run on a schedule, pulling fresh data automatically. No more manual updates, no more “Can you regenerate last week’s report with the latest numbers?”</p>\n<p>Let’s see this in action.</p>\n<p>Below is a snapshot of our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VEde8rNJMXY?si=DcxPge3T2fGLwzCt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Flow by Appsilon</a> interface, where we’re generating a Quarto report to analyze <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/rhinoverse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Appsilon’s open source packages</a> on GitHub. The code is automatically generated based on natural language instructions, transforming a simple request into a detailed analysis of our repositories’ popularity and community engagement. The second image shows the same report deployed on Posit Connect, where it runs automatically on a schedule, keeping our open source metrics fresh and accessible to the whole team.</p>\n<p>‍</p>\n<figure class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n<div><img alt=\"\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.prod.website-files.com/654fd3ad88635290d9845b9e/67c20b74abd91c04de8e855b_AD_4nXckzDpwJOb4tlUnl-1UC6qG6UXsDe6iWjHYTybKI0X-Itg9J7b_tgXtnc9tn9FVe0KZST8tdCUTbbQvtl_or55kx8GiMXUMyvfvlzV5SdLyk_LglWpnD-5h-VjRHOd98IYYY60NCg.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cdn.prod.website-files.com/654fd3ad88635290d9845b9e/67c20b74abd91c04de8e855b_AD_4nXckzDpwJOb4tlUnl-1UC6qG6UXsDe6iWjHYTybKI0X-Itg9J7b_tgXtnc9tn9FVe0KZST8tdCUTbbQvtl_or55kx8GiMXUMyvfvlzV5SdLyk_LglWpnD-5h-VjRHOd98IYYY60NCg.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></div>\n</figure>\n<p>‍</p>\n<figure class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image\">\n<div><img alt=\"\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.prod.website-files.com/654fd3ad88635290d9845b9e/67c20d1ff6a85df3f5890f4f_Untitled%20design.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.prod.website-files.com/654fd3ad88635290d9845b9e/67c20d1ff6a85df3f5890f4f_Untitled%20design.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></div>\n</figure>\n<p>‍</p>\n<p>The real power lies in the flexibility. Your report can connect to any data source your systems have access to – whether it’s real-time sales data, API responses, or database queries. Each time the report runs, it fetches the latest data, applies the agreed-upon transformations, and generates fresh visualizations. What used to be a recurring task on someone’s calendar becomes a reliable automated process.</p>\n<blockquote><p>New to Posit Connect? <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/deploying-to-rstudio-connect\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Our beginner’s guide walks you through the deployment process step by step.</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>\n<p>Let’s look at how teams are putting this approach into practice. Take our marketing team’s weekly analytics challenge: their data lives in multiple platforms, requiring someone to manually gather numbers, copy them into spreadsheets, and calculate key metrics. Now, their LLM-assisted Quarto report automatically pulls data from various sources every Monday morning. The marketing team starts their week with fresh insights instead of tedious data gathering.</p>\n<p>The sales team scenario shows how this approach bridges communication gaps. During a focused three-hour session, a sales manager explained their team’s reporting needs while a data scientist translated requirements into code with LLM assistance. What made this collaboration special wasn’t just the speed – it was the immediate feedback loop. The sales manager could see their requirements taking shape in real-time, suggesting adjustments as the report evolved. The result? A weekly automated report that exactly matches their needs, no long email threads required.</p>\n<p>On a different, inspiring note, for developers coming from web or backend backgrounds, data reports might seem like unfamiliar territory. But combined with LLM assistance, the learning curve becomes much gentler. They can leverage their existing programming knowledge to validate and refine the generated code, while the LLM handles Quarto-specific best practices and visualization patterns. In this process developers learn along the way becoming better developers but also expending their data science knowledge and skills.</p>\n<h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>\n<p>Ready to try this approach in your organization? Here’s what you need to succeed:</p>\n<p>Start small but impactful. Look for a straightforward, frequently-used report that consistently takes up your team’s time. The ideal first candidate isn’t your most complex dashboard – it’s that weekly status report that someone has to manually update every Monday morning. Success with simpler reports builds confidence and helps establish patterns for more complex implementations.</p>\n<p>Set up a collaborative session with both technical and business stakeholders. This isn’t just a standard meeting – it’s a working session where you’ll actually build something. At Appsilon, we use our internal tooling for this process, but you can achieve similar results working with LLMs like Claude or GPT to generate the Quarto code in an <a href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Artifact</a>/<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Canvas</a>, which your technical team can then implement and validate. The specific tools matter less than the collaborative approach – what’s important is bringing technical and business teams together in real-time to iterate on the solution. If everyone on your team is busy,<a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> consider a session together with us </a>to show you what’s possible and get a head start.</p>\n<p>When developing with LLM assistance, treat it as a coding partner that’s fast but needs supervision. Let it handle the initial code structure and visualizations, then leverage your technical expertise to validate and refine the solution. Don’t hesitate to iterate on your prompts – sometimes the third or fourth suggestion hits exactly what you need.</p>\n<p>Finally, before deploying to Posit Connect, ensure your automated report has robust error handling. Your report should handle common issues gracefully and provide clear feedback when something goes wrong. This attention to reliability transforms a useful script into a trusted business tool.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Protect your applications from vulnerabilities. <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/r-shiny-app-security#error-handling\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Learn how to implement authentication, encryption, error handling and other security best practices.</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>LLMs aren’t replacing your data science team – they’re enhancing your team’s capabilities. By combining LLM-assisted development with Quarto and Posit Connect, you can transform time-consuming manual reports into automated solutions. The real magic isn’t in the technology itself, but in how it enables closer collaboration between technical and business teams.</p>\n<p>Start small, focus on reports that matter, and let your technical team validate the output. You might be surprised how quickly a three-hour collaborative session can turn into months of saved time and more valuable analyses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ready to transform your reporting workflow? <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Let us know how we can help.</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"blog-side-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"blog-form-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"shadow-xsmall\">\n<div class=\"slack_banner_wraper\">\n<div class=\"wrap_flex-h\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post appeared first on appsilon.com/blog/.</p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"https://appsilon.com/llm-quarto-automation/\"> Tag: r - Appsilon | Enterprise R Shiny Dashboards</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr/>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\n\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\n</div> </div>\n</article>",

Each iteration gets them closer to exactly what they want – sometimes by improving the prompts, sometimes by tweaking the code. The result? The same report, running automatically every month on\nPosit Connect\n, always with fresh data. No more manual updates, no more waiting for the data team’s bandwidth.\nWant to create Quarto reports in VS Code?\nLearn how to integrate Quarto with Python for seamless reporting.\nBut let’s be clear – this isn’t about replacing data scientists with AI. It’s about eliminating repetitive work and bridging the gap between teams. LLMs excel at generating boilerplate\nQuarto\ncode and suggesting visualizations, while your technical team ensures the output is correct and maintainable. Think of it as pair programming, where one partner types incredibly fast but needs a code review for every commit.\nThis approach isn’t limited to sales reports. At Appsilon, we’ve seen marketing teams automate their cross-platform analytics, converting hours of manual data gathering into automated weekly insights. The key? Combining LLM-powered rapid development with proper technical validation and\nPosit Connect\n‘s automation capabilities.\nWant to add AI to your Shiny for Python apps?\nLearn how to integrate LLMs effectively with practical insights from our latest guide.\nThe Reality of LLM-Assisted Development\nWorking with LLMs on Quarto reports means having access to an encyclopedic knowledge of visualization techniques and data presentation patterns. Whether you need summary statistics, trend analysis, or performance metrics, LLMs can suggest effective ways to present your data and handle the complexities of data transformations.\nThe development process transforms into a dynamic conversation. Business teams can watch their ideas take shape in real-time, with no lengthy requirement documents or back-and-forth emails. Your team can rapidly prototype different approaches: “Show me a funnel chart for conversion rates.” “Now add cohort analysis.” “Let’s try a heatmap instead.” Each iteration takes seconds instead of minutes.\nThe key lies in understanding how to refine LLM suggestions. While they occasionally mix up parameter names or suggest deprecated functions, your technical team knows exactly how to spot and fix these issues. Additionally each generation of models gets better and cheaper so this workflow will only get better and easier. This combination of rapid prototyping and technical validation turns what used to be hours of repetitive weekly work into a one-time development session, resulting in an automated solution that runs reliably week after week.\nManaging a remote data science team?\nSee why Posit Connect is the perfect platform for collaboration and deployment.\nThe Power of Automation\nThis is where Quarto and Posit Connect transform a one-off script into a sustainable solution. Once your report is ready and validated, deploying it to Posit Connect means it can run on a schedule, pulling fresh data automatically. No more manual updates, no more “Can you regenerate last week’s report with the latest numbers?”\nLet’s see this in action.\nBelow is a snapshot of our\nFlow by Appsilon\ninterface, where we’re generating a Quarto report to analyze\nAppsilon’s open source packages\non GitHub. The code is automatically generated based on natural language instructions, transforming a simple request into a detailed analysis of our repositories’ popularity and community engagement. The second image shows the same report deployed on Posit Connect, where it runs automatically on a schedule, keeping our open source metrics fresh and accessible to the whole team.\n‍\n‍\n‍\nThe real power lies in the flexibility. Your report can connect to any data source your systems have access to – whether it’s real-time sales data, API responses, or database queries. Each time the report runs, it fetches the latest data, applies the agreed-upon transformations, and generates fresh visualizations. What used to be a recurring task on someone’s calendar becomes a reliable automated process.\nNew to Posit Connect?\nOur beginner’s guide walks you through the deployment process step by step.\nReal-World Applications\nLet’s look at how teams are putting this approach into practice. Take our marketing team’s weekly analytics challenge: their data lives in multiple platforms, requiring someone to manually gather numbers, copy them into spreadsheets, and calculate key metrics. Now, their LLM-assisted Quarto report automatically pulls data from various sources every Monday morning. The marketing team starts their week with fresh insights instead of tedious data gathering.\nThe sales team scenario shows how this approach bridges communication gaps. During a focused three-hour session, a sales manager explained their team’s reporting needs while a data scientist translated requirements into code with LLM assistance. What made this collaboration special wasn’t just the speed – it was the immediate feedback loop. The sales manager could see their requirements taking shape in real-time, suggesting adjustments as the report evolved. The result? A weekly automated report that exactly matches their needs, no long email threads required.\nOn a different, inspiring note, for developers coming from web or backend backgrounds, data reports might seem like unfamiliar territory. But combined with LLM assistance, the learning curve becomes much gentler. They can leverage their existing programming knowledge to validate and refine the generated code, while the LLM handles Quarto-specific best practices and visualization patterns. In this process developers learn along the way becoming better developers but also expending their data science knowledge and skills.\nImplementation Strategy\nReady to try this approach in your organization? Here’s what you need to succeed:\nStart small but impactful. Look for a straightforward, frequently-used report that consistently takes up your team’s time. The ideal first candidate isn’t your most complex dashboard – it’s that weekly status report that someone has to manually update every Monday morning. Success with simpler reports builds confidence and helps establish patterns for more complex implementations.\nSet up a collaborative session with both technical and business stakeholders. This isn’t just a standard meeting – it’s a working session where you’ll actually build something. At Appsilon, we use our internal tooling for this process, but you can achieve similar results working with LLMs like Claude or GPT to generate the Quarto code in an\nArtifact\n/\nCanvas\n, which your technical team can then implement and validate. The specific tools matter less than the collaborative approach – what’s important is bringing technical and business teams together in real-time to iterate on the solution. If everyone on your team is busy,\nconsider a session together with us\nto show you what’s possible and get a head start.\nWhen developing with LLM assistance, treat it as a coding partner that’s fast but needs supervision. Let it handle the initial code structure and visualizations, then leverage your technical expertise to validate and refine the solution. Don’t hesitate to iterate on your prompts – sometimes the third or fourth suggestion hits exactly what you need.\nFinally, before deploying to Posit Connect, ensure your automated report has robust error handling. Your report should handle common issues gracefully and provide clear feedback when something goes wrong. This attention to reliability transforms a useful script into a trusted business tool.\nProtect your applications from vulnerabilities.\nLearn how to implement authentication, encryption, error handling and other security best practices.\nConclusion\nLLMs aren’t replacing your data science team – they’re enhancing your team’s capabilities. By combining LLM-assisted development with Quarto and Posit Connect, you can transform time-consuming manual reports into automated solutions. The real magic isn’t in the technology itself, but in how it enables closer collaboration between technical and business teams.\nStart small, focus on reports that matter, and let your technical team validate the output. You might be surprised how quickly a three-hour collaborative session can turn into months of saved time and more valuable analyses.\nReady to transform your reporting workflow?\nLet us know how we can help.\nThe post appeared first on appsilon.com/blog/.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nTag: r - Appsilon | Enterprise R Shiny Dashboards\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
