Build Skills &amp; Knowledge Base</strong></h3>\n<p>To ensure a smooth transition to open-source tools, leaders should assess current team skill levels in R, Python, Git, and other relevant technologies. Identifying gaps and implementing structured training sessions, hands-on workshops, and mentorship programs can facilitate adoption. Equally important is ensuring readiness for change through transparent communication about the transition plan and the long-term benefits of open-source adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lexjansen.com/phuse/2023/tt/PAP_TT09.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GSK targets 50% open-source code adoption by 2025</a>, retraining staff in R and other tools to ensure compliance and efficiency. To support this transition, GSK has invested in structured programs, ensuring teams are proficient in R and other open-source tools while maintaining compliance and reliability. Another example is <a href=\"https://r-consortium.org/webinars/from-vision-to-action-the-pfizer-r-center-of-excellence.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pfizer’s R Center of Excellence</a>, where teams are supported with R expertise and training.</p>\n<figure class=\"w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-video\">\n<div></div>\n</figure>\n<p>Roche’s successful end-to-end submission using R stands as an example of how open-source tools can be effectively integrated into clinical trials data management and analytics. These tools were essential in Roche’s submission of a breast cancer trial to regulatory bodies such as the FDA, EMA, and NMPA. The trial, which utilized standardized designs and analyses, was structured to meet the rigorous requirements of these agencies. To streamline the process, Roche utilized a suite of open-source tools:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">{admiral}</a> for ADaM datasets<strong>, </strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiralonco/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">{admiral.onco}</a> for oncology-specific datasets<strong>, </strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">{teal}</a> for Shiny applications</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">{rtables}</a> for creating clinical tables<strong>, </strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pharmaverse/sdtm.oak\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">{oak} for SDTM mapping</a><strong>, </strong>and</li>\n<li>Roche proprietary admiral package for aligning with internal data standards<strong>. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Roche’s infrastructure, built on the Ocean platform (an AWS-hosted system), utilized containerized environments to ensure both reproducibility and security. To maintain compliance, they adhered to internal validation processes that mirrored the guidelines set by the R Validation Hub. Dual programming with SAS provided an added layer of confidence in the accuracy of the results. Tools like {pkgdown} and {pkgload} were used to streamline documentation and package validation.

Equally important is ensuring readiness for change through transparent communication about the transition plan and the long-term benefits of open-source adoption.\nExample:\nGSK targets 50% open-source code adoption by 2025\n, retraining staff in R and other tools to ensure compliance and efficiency. To support this transition, GSK has invested in structured programs, ensuring teams are proficient in R and other open-source tools while maintaining compliance and reliability. Another example is\nPfizer’s R Center of Excellence\n, where teams are supported with R expertise and training.\nRoche’s successful end-to-end submission using R stands as an example of how open-source tools can be effectively integrated into clinical trials data management and analytics. These tools were essential in Roche’s submission of a breast cancer trial to regulatory bodies such as the FDA, EMA, and NMPA. The trial, which utilized standardized designs and analyses, was structured to meet the rigorous requirements of these agencies. To streamline the process, Roche utilized a suite of open-source tools:\n{admiral}\nfor ADaM datasets\n,\n{admiral.onco}\nfor oncology-specific datasets\n,\n{teal}\nfor Shiny applications\n{rtables}\nfor creating clinical tables\n,\n{oak} for SDTM mapping\n,\nand\nRoche proprietary admiral package for aligning with internal data standards\n.\nRoche’s infrastructure, built on the Ocean platform (an AWS-hosted system), utilized containerized environments to ensure both reproducibility and security. To maintain compliance, they adhered to internal validation processes that mirrored the guidelines set by the R Validation Hub. Dual programming with SAS provided an added layer of confidence in the accuracy of the results. Tools like {pkgdown} and {pkgload} were used to streamline documentation and package validation. The final submission package included detailed installation instructions and validation reports, ensuring alignment with regulatory expectations.\nKey Insights on Open Source Adoption in Pharma\nAdopting open-source solutions in the pharmaceutical industry requires a thoughtful, long-term strategy, significant internal investment, and collaboration across the sector.
