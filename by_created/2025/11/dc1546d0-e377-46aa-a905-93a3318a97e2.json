The throughput curve shoots up the y-axis until it hits the ceiling at X = 2.0 requests/per-unit-time. Consequently, the linear rising slope on the early part of the throughput curve is almost indistinguishable from the optimal load-line at N* = 1.016 clients. This rapid saturation effect is less pronounced in a system with more queues because there are more service stages and completion therefore takes longer. But it requires a considerable number of additional queueing centers to get a noticeable difference, e.g., K = 20, 50.

In addition to the measured tiers, I ended up introducing 12 “dummy” queues in order to produce the correct round-trip latency, whilst retaining Z = 0 think time in accord with the original web application test scripts.
