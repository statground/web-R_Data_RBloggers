Looking into the future, I will continue to improve on my project and share it with the rOpenSci community.\nMy journey as a rOpenSci Champion has been a rollercoaster of discovery, and ChartkickR stands as a reward. I am grateful for this opportunity given to me by rOpenSci, the support of the rOpenSci community, the guidance of my mentor, and the opportunities for growth that this program has provided. As I look back on this experience, I am not only proud of the htmlwidget I created but also of the person I’ve become throughout this incredible journey.\nBy\ndefinition\n, an R ‘htmlwidget’ is a framework for creating HTML widgets that render in various contexts including the R console, ‘R Markdown’ documents, and ‘Shiny’ web applications.\n↩︎\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
