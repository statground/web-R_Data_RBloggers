In particular, Jonas research interests are regularized regression models for mixed frequency data and factor-augmented sparse regression models. Before joining the Copenhagen Business School in 2022, he was a research fellow at the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique—FNRS and Université Catholique de Louvain, where he carried out my PhD under the supervision of prof.
