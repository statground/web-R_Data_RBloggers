I started getting involved with the R community in 2017 when I joined the <a href=\"https://pdxrlang.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Portland R User Group</a>. As a faculty member at a university, people realized that I had access to spaces that could host a conference. I co-organized a conference called Cascadia R when I first joined the R community.

I would estimate that 50% of the community is academic, 25% is government, and 25% is industry. This has created a pleasant mix in the R user group, as people have experience in all of these different areas. For example, one of our organizers, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marley-buchman-767766103/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Marley</a>, does a lot of work in economics and spatial analysis. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanysbarker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Brittany</a>, another one of our co-organizers, does a lot of work in forestry and ecology. <a href=\"http://learningalliances.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">John</a> works for a spiritual/meditation group and does a lot of work with people data.</p>\n<p>Portland R is a really interesting mix of people, and we have learned a lot from each other.
