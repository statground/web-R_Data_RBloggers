Object-oriented programming was used in S to provide a common set of functions for interacting with statistical models. OOP makes it easy to provide end users with a uniform interface to a family of different classes (e.g. different statistical models).</p>\n<p>OOP provides developers with flexibility and allows their code to be more modular. There are multiple ways of doing OOP in R, and more are being developed.

For example, you can make predictions using a linear regression model.\nOOP Systems in R\nAll right, so how do we do OOP in R? Turns out R provides different ways of doing OOP:\nS3\nS4\nReference Classes (referred to as RC or sometimes R5)\nR6\nInterested in experiencing R6 Classes in action while designing a video game in R Shiny? Check out our article,\nHow to Build a Video Game in R Shiny with CSS, JavaScript, and R6 Classes.\nOn top of that, there is a new OOP being developed called\nS7 (previously also called R7)\n, and there are also other packages R packages providing ways of doing OOP in R including:\nproto\nR.oo\nSome packages also defined their own OOP systems; for example,\ntorch defined its own OOP system called R7\n(not to be confused with R7 developed by the R Consortium, which is now called S7).\nEach of those has its own advantages and disadvantages that we will be exploring in subsequent articles, so stay tuned.\nConclusion\nThe first appearance of OOP in R comes from the S language. Object-oriented programming was used in S to provide a common set of functions for interacting with statistical models. OOP makes it easy to provide end users with a uniform interface to a family of different classes (e.g. different statistical models).\nOOP provides developers with flexibility and allows their code to be more modular. There are multiple ways of doing OOP in R, and more are being developed. We’ll dive deeper into object-oriented programming in R; stay tuned for our next article in this series.\nHave questions about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in R or need support with your enterprise R/Shiny project?\nFeel free to reach out to us for assistance!\nThe post appeared first on appsilon.com/blog/.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nTag: r - Appsilon | Enterprise R Shiny Dashboards\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
