Often, folks from my lab will take an R course and spend a half-day making some plots of the <code>iris</code> dataset or calculating miles per gallon using <code>mtcars</code>. Once they leave the room, it is hard for them to connect what they learned to a real-life use case in the lab. This is not a criticism of those courses, <a href=\"https://quantixed.org/2020/02/18/get-better-r-for-absolute-beginners/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">I have run a workshop like that</a>, but the question is how can we empower cell biologists (or other wet lab scientists) to use R for their work?</p>\n<p>This is my first attempt at solving this problem. The materials and brief descriptions are in this <a href=\"https://github.com/quantixed/r-for-cell-biologists\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repo</a>. Below is a full description. Skip to <a href=\"https://quantixed.org/2025/01/20/get-better-r-for-cell-biologists/#outcome\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for thoughts on how it went.</p>\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">“R for Cell Biologists” workshop</h1>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Three concepts need to be introduced:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. why we use R rather than Microsoft Excel</h3>\n<p>Emphasise reproducibility, automation, and publication-quality graphics.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. the pathway from experiment to figure</h3>\n<p>A typical experiment involves setting up cells, imaging them on the microscope, analysing the images in Fiji, and the output of the analysis is plain text files, one for each image.<br/>To make a figure, we need to process all of these text files and turn them into publication-quality figures, using R.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. the steps in R are always the same</h3>\n<p>We need to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Read in the data</li>\n<li>Do some calculations or processing (optional)</li>\n<li>Make some plots</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additionally…</h3>\n<p>Depending on the experience of the group, other concepts may need introducing:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>RStudio as an IDE (what the different panes are for)</li>\n<li>R as a language</li>\n<li>scripting basics</li>\n<li>1-based vs 0-based languages</li>\n<li>base R, tidyverse, packages</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The hands-on part</h2>\n<p>Before we tackle steps 1-3 of an R analysis, we have a step 0 which is to set up an R project to work <em>reproducibly</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">0. R Project setup</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start a new project in RStudio: File &gt; New Project… then New Directory, name the project (suggestion: training_yymmdd) and save somewhere on your computer.</li>\n<li>Run the script <code>00_r_project_setup.R</code> or paste this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/quantixed/42625f988a7b5da25b7e333c4a660b97\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">gist</a> into the console and press enter.</li>\n<li>Using the course materials, move or copy the scripts into <code>Script/</code> and the data files into <code>Data/</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key concept:</strong> a standardised directory structure within the R Project folder helps us to easily process data and save the outputs to a standardised place.<br/><strong>Key concept:</strong> We always use the R Project folder as our working directory.<br/>It makes the project portable and doesn’t rely on paths to folders on a specific computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges to success:</strong> the aim is to get participants to making a plot of the data promptly. If the steps of setup and data import take too long, participants can get lost, so the clock is ticking…</p>\n<p><strong>Steps 1-3</strong> execute the script <code>02_training.R</code> line by line (cmd + Enter on Mac; ctrl + Enter on Windows/Linux), explaining what each line does as you go.<br/>Check for understanding throughout.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Read in the data</h3>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong> make one data frame containing all the data</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Begin by reading in one file into a data frame, explain that we have 80 files to read in.</li>\n<li>Show how we can read all of them in to one huge data frame using a simple command</li>\n<li>But how do we know which rows belong to what condition and/or which experimental repeat?</li>\n<li>Use the filename to append information as it is read in.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>\n## 1. Load data ----\n# read one csv file into R as an object called temp\ntemp &lt;- read.csv(\"Data/control_n1_1.csv\")\n# have a look at it\nView(temp)\n# remove the object\nrm(temp)\n\n# we want to load all files, so we need to get a list of all files\nlist.files(\"Data\")\n# assign this list as an object\nfilelist &lt;- list.files(\"Data\")\n# use the path to the file\nfilelist &lt;- list.files(\"Data\", full.names = TRUE)\n\n# load all files and rbind into big dataframe\ndf &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, read.csv))\nView(df)\n# load all files and rbind into big dataframe, add a column to each file to identify each file\ndf &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {temp &lt;- read.csv(x); temp$file &lt;- x; temp}))\n# this can be written on multiple lines\ndf &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {\n  temp &lt;- read.csv(x)\n  temp$file &lt;- x\n  temp\n}))\n# this is close to what we want but remember that we used full paths to load the files, we only want the file name\n# we can use the basename function to extract the file name\ndf &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {\n  temp &lt;- read.csv(x);\n  temp$file &lt;- basename(x);\n  temp\n}))\n# file column has name of the file, name is of the form foo_bar_1.csv, extract foo and bar into two columns\ndf$cond &lt;- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 1)\ndf$expt &lt;- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 2)\n# explain why the above works\n# strsplit(df$file, \"_\") returns a list of vectors, each vector is the result of splitting the string by \"_\"\n# we can extract the first element of each vector using \"[\", 1\n# we can extract the second element of each vector using \"[\", 2\n# sapply applies the function to each element of the list\n# what does \"[\" do? it extracts elements from a vector\n# what does \"[[\" do? it extracts elements from a list\n</pre>\n<p>A whiteboard illustration can be used to show participants how importing 1 or 80 files works. It can be helpful to visualise how we add extra columns to the data frame to identify them.</p>\n<p><strong>Key concept:</strong> think about how you’ll name the outputs of your analysis in Fiji to make reading the data into R as easy as possible.</p>\n<p>An alternative workflow that we use in the lab is to use nested folders for conditions and experimental repeats, rather than a flat structure as in this example.<br/>In that case, folder names are used to append information to the data frame.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges to success: </strong>we use a very simple “one-liner” in base R to load in the data. Unfortunately, it is complicated to explain how this works. DO NOT get caught up in explaining alternatives. Of course there are many ways to achieve this part. The workshop does not use for-loops and the participants do not need to understand them to get to their goal. Remember, they are not here to learn R programming <em>per se</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Do some calculations</h3>\n<p>This is an optional step.<br/>Some examples are shown but they are not needed for this exercise, as we will simply plot the data.</p>\n<pre>\n## 2. Calculations ----\n# normalise the data in the Mean column - just as an example\ndf$MeanNorm &lt;- df$Mean / max(df$Mean)\n# standardise the data in the Mean column - just as an example\ndf$MeanStand &lt;- (df$Mean - mean(df$Mean)) / sd(df$Mean)\n\n# since we have messed things up a bit, we can remake the df easily\n# run the top part again to remake the df and then save the output\nfilelist &lt;- list.files(\"Data\", full.names = TRUE)\ndf &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {\n  temp &lt;- read.csv(x);\n  temp$file &lt;- basename(x);\n  temp\n}))\ndf$cond &lt;- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 1)\ndf$expt &lt;- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 2)\n# write data to file\nwrite.csv(df, \"Output/Data/df.csv\")\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Key concept:</strong> use this part to re-emphasise the power of scripting by showing how we can recreate the dataframe easily in just a few lines of code.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Make some plots</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use ggplot to make some plots</li>\n<li>Explain grammar of graphics and demonstrate the power of facetting, theming and so on</li>\n<li>Explore the data, notice that one experiment is different to the others</li>\n<li>Make a SuperPlot</li>\n<li>Save the SuperPlot</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>\n## 3. Visualisation ----\n# we will use ggplot2 for visualisation\n# note that library loading usually goes at the top of the script!\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# histogram to look at the data\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_histogram()\n# density plot to look at the data\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n# facetting, make plots by expt\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~expt)\n# themes\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~expt) + theme_minimal()\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~expt) + theme_bw()\n\n# superplot\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) + geom_jitter()\nlibrary(ggforce)\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) + geom_sina()\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) + geom_sina(position = \"auto\")\n# calculate experiment means\nsummary_df &lt;- aggregate(Mean ~ cond + expt, data = df, FUN = mean)\n# add to plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) +\n  geom_sina(position = \"auto\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(data = summary_df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt), shape = 15, size = 3)\n# keep adding to this or\np &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) +\n  geom_sina(position = \"auto\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(data = summary_df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt), shape = 15, size = 3)\np + theme_minimal()\np + theme_bw()\np + theme_bw() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#4477aa\", \"#ccbb44\", \"#ee6677\",\"#228833\"))\n\n# save plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) +\n  geom_sina(position = \"auto\", alpha = 0.5, maxwidth = 0.2) +\n  geom_point(data = summary_df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt), shape = 15, size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#4477aa\", \"#ccbb44\", \"#ee6677\",\"#228833\")) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Mitochondria Fluorescence (A.U.)\") +\n  theme_bw(10) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\nggsave(\"Output/Plots/output.png\", width = 6, height = 4, dpi = 300)\n# this is an easy way\n\n# stats\n# t-test\nt.test(summary_df$Mean ~ summary_df$cond)\n</pre>\n<p>In this part you will use two libraries <code>{ggplot2}</code> and <code>{ggforce}</code>. Participants will see some plots for the first time and use this as a chance to talk about the data in cell biological terms. The dataset is designed to have an irregularity (see below) and so you can use this as a chance to get the participants to flex their cell biological knowledge of why that may be!</p>\n<figure

It has definitely resulted in some lab members, who previously avoided R, to start using it for their own data analysis. In fact, they use the script for this session as the basis for their own. This has had the unintended consequence of standardising lab scripts, which in turn makes them easier to troubleshoot.</p>\n<p>The first time we ran the training, we also paired it with a Fiji workshop so that participants could think about the entire workflow.

Again, if this improves lab members work habits, that’s only a good thing.</p>\n<p>The materials can probably be refined. As they are, they take 90 min to cover and if there’s questions, it can get quite tight.

    "main_text": "Get Better: R for cell biologists\nPosted on\nJanuary 20, 2025\nby\nStephen Royle\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nRstats – quantixed\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nHow can we teach “R for cell biologists” rather than teaching R\nto\ncell biologists?\nI’ve noticed that many R training courses will teach R – regardless of who is taking the course – and leave it to the participants to figure out how they can use R in their own discipline. Often, folks from my lab will take an R course and spend a half-day making some plots of the\niris\ndataset or calculating miles per gallon using\nmtcars\n. Once they leave the room, it is hard for them to connect what they learned to a real-life use case in the lab. This is not a criticism of those courses,\nI have run a workshop like that\n, but the question is how can we empower cell biologists (or other wet lab scientists) to use R for their work?\nThis is my first attempt at solving this problem. The materials and brief descriptions are in this\nGitHub repo\n. Below is a full description. Skip to\nhere\nfor thoughts on how it went.\n“R for Cell Biologists” workshop\nIntroduction\nThree concepts need to be introduced:\n1. why we use R rather than Microsoft Excel\nEmphasise reproducibility, automation, and publication-quality graphics.\n2. the pathway from experiment to figure\nA typical experiment involves setting up cells, imaging them on the microscope, analysing the images in Fiji, and the output of the analysis is plain text files, one for each image.\nTo make a figure, we need to process all of these text files and turn them into publication-quality figures, using R.\n3. the steps in R are always the same\nWe need to:\nRead in the data\nDo some calculations or processing (optional)\nMake some plots\nAdditionally…\nDepending on the experience of the group, other concepts may need introducing:\nRStudio as an IDE (what the different panes are for)\nR as a language\nscripting basics\n1-based vs 0-based languages\nbase R, tidyverse, packages\nThe hands-on part\nBefore we tackle steps 1-3 of an R analysis, we have a step 0 which is to set up an R project to work\nreproducibly\n.\n0. R Project setup\nStart a new project in RStudio: File > New Project… then New Directory, name the project (suggestion: training_yymmdd) and save somewhere on your computer.\nRun the script\n00_r_project_setup.R\nor paste this\ngist\ninto the console and press enter.\nUsing the course materials, move or copy the scripts into\nScript/\nand the data files into\nData/\nKey concept:\na standardised directory structure within the R Project folder helps us to easily process data and save the outputs to a standardised place.\nKey concept:\nWe always use the R Project folder as our working directory.\nIt makes the project portable and doesn’t rely on paths to folders on a specific computer.\nChallenges to success:\nthe aim is to get participants to making a plot of the data promptly. If the steps of setup and data import take too long, participants can get lost, so the clock is ticking…\nSteps 1-3\nexecute the script\n02_training.R\nline by line (cmd + Enter on Mac; ctrl + Enter on Windows/Linux), explaining what each line does as you go.\nCheck for understanding throughout.\n1. Read in the data\nGoal:\nmake one data frame containing all the data\nBegin by reading in one file into a data frame, explain that we have 80 files to read in.\nShow how we can read all of them in to one huge data frame using a simple command\nBut how do we know which rows belong to what condition and/or which experimental repeat?\nUse the filename to append information as it is read in.\n## 1. Load data ----\n# read one csv file into R as an object called temp\ntemp <- read.csv(\"Data/control_n1_1.csv\")\n# have a look at it\nView(temp)\n# remove the object\nrm(temp)\n\n# we want to load all files, so we need to get a list of all files\nlist.files(\"Data\")\n# assign this list as an object\nfilelist <- list.files(\"Data\")\n# use the path to the file\nfilelist <- list.files(\"Data\", full.names = TRUE)\n\n# load all files and rbind into big dataframe\ndf <- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, read.csv))\nView(df)\n# load all files and rbind into big dataframe, add a column to each file to identify each file\ndf <- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {temp <- read.csv(x); temp$file <- x; temp}))\n# this can be written on multiple lines\ndf <- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {\n  temp <- read.csv(x)\n  temp$file <- x\n  temp\n}))\n# this is close to what we want but remember that we used full paths to load the files, we only want the file name\n# we can use the basename function to extract the file name\ndf <- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {\n  temp <- read.csv(x);\n  temp$file <- basename(x);\n  temp\n}))\n# file column has name of the file, name is of the form foo_bar_1.csv, extract foo and bar into two columns\ndf$cond <- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 1)\ndf$expt <- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 2)\n# explain why the above works\n# strsplit(df$file, \"_\") returns a list of vectors, each vector is the result of splitting the string by \"_\"\n# we can extract the first element of each vector using \"[\", 1\n# we can extract the second element of each vector using \"[\", 2\n# sapply applies the function to each element of the list\n# what does \"[\" do? it extracts elements from a vector\n# what does \"[[\" do? it extracts elements from a list\nA whiteboard illustration can be used to show participants how importing 1 or 80 files works. It can be helpful to visualise how we add extra columns to the data frame to identify them.\nKey concept:\nthink about how you’ll name the outputs of your analysis in Fiji to make reading the data into R as easy as possible.\nAn alternative workflow that we use in the lab is to use nested folders for conditions and experimental repeats, rather than a flat structure as in this example.\nIn that case, folder names are used to append information to the data frame.\nChallenges to success:\nwe use a very simple “one-liner” in base R to load in the data. Unfortunately, it is complicated to explain how this works. DO NOT get caught up in explaining alternatives. Of course there are many ways to achieve this part. The workshop does not use for-loops and the participants do not need to understand them to get to their goal. Remember, they are not here to learn R programming\nper se\n.\n2. Do some calculations\nThis is an optional step.\nSome examples are shown but they are not needed for this exercise, as we will simply plot the data.\n## 2. Calculations ----\n# normalise the data in the Mean column - just as an example\ndf$MeanNorm <- df$Mean / max(df$Mean)\n# standardise the data in the Mean column - just as an example\ndf$MeanStand <- (df$Mean - mean(df$Mean)) / sd(df$Mean)\n\n# since we have messed things up a bit, we can remake the df easily\n# run the top part again to remake the df and then save the output\nfilelist <- list.files(\"Data\", full.names = TRUE)\ndf <- do.call(rbind, lapply(filelist, function(x) {\n  temp <- read.csv(x);\n  temp$file <- basename(x);\n  temp\n}))\ndf$cond <- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 1)\ndf$expt <- sapply(strsplit(df$file, \"_\"), \"[\", 2)\n# write data to file\nwrite.csv(df, \"Output/Data/df.csv\")\nKey concept:\nuse this part to re-emphasise the power of scripting by showing how we can recreate the dataframe easily in just a few lines of code.\n3. Make some plots\nUse ggplot to make some plots\nExplain grammar of graphics and demonstrate the power of facetting, theming and so on\nExplore the data, notice that one experiment is different to the others\nMake a SuperPlot\nSave the SuperPlot\n## 3. Visualisation ----\n# we will use ggplot2 for visualisation\n# note that library loading usually goes at the top of the script!\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# histogram to look at the data\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_histogram()\n# density plot to look at the data\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n# facetting, make plots by expt\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~expt)\n# themes\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~expt) + theme_minimal()\nggplot(df, aes(x = Mean, fill = cond)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + facet_wrap(~expt) + theme_bw()\n\n# superplot\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) + geom_jitter()\nlibrary(ggforce)\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) + geom_sina()\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) + geom_sina(position = \"auto\")\n# calculate experiment means\nsummary_df <- aggregate(Mean ~ cond + expt, data = df, FUN = mean)\n# add to plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) +\n  geom_sina(position = \"auto\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(data = summary_df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt), shape = 15, size = 3)\n# keep adding to this or\np <- ggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) +\n  geom_sina(position = \"auto\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(data = summary_df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt), shape = 15, size = 3)\np + theme_minimal()\np + theme_bw()\np + theme_bw() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#4477aa\", \"#ccbb44\", \"#ee6677\",\"#228833\"))\n\n# save plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt)) +\n  geom_sina(position = \"auto\", alpha = 0.5, maxwidth = 0.2) +\n  geom_point(data = summary_df, aes(x = cond, y = Mean, colour = expt), shape = 15, size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#4477aa\", \"#ccbb44\", \"#ee6677\",\"#228833\")) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Mitochondria Fluorescence (A.U.)\") +\n  theme_bw(10) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\nggsave(\"Output/Plots/output.png\", width = 6, height = 4, dpi = 300)\n# this is an easy way\n\n# stats\n# t-test\nt.test(summary_df$Mean ~ summary_df$cond)\nIn this part you will use two libraries\n{ggplot2}\nand\n{ggforce}\n. Participants will see some plots for the first time and use this as a chance to talk about the data in cell biological terms. The dataset is designed to have an irregularity (see below) and so you can use this as a chance to get the participants to flex their cell biological knowledge of why that may be!\nKey concept:\nthe data frame you made has all the information to make any plot you’d need.\nHomework\nTo consolidate the learning, ask the participants to figure out how to do the following:\nWhich row (from which experiment/condition/cell) had the lowest Mean value?\nNext, explain that the person who did the experiments found out that the rapamycin used in the 4th experiment, was prepared from a stock solution which was at the wrong concentration.\nHow can we exclude the n4 data and remake a new SuperPlot so that all experiments used the correct concentration?\nExplain that getting assistance from an LLM is unlikely to help them learn. Searching for a solution is fine. Let them know a keyword to look up: subset/subsetting.\nSolutions can be discussed in a follow-up session or via slack etc.\nHow did it go?\nI’ve run this training workshop twice and the feedback has been good both times. It has definitely resulted in some lab members, who previously avoided R, to start using it for their own data analysis. In fact, they use the script for this session as the basis for their own. This has had the unintended consequence of standardising lab scripts, which in turn makes them easier to troubleshoot.\nThe first time we ran the training, we also paired it with a Fiji workshop so that participants could think about the entire workflow. For this we used an image analysis problem that needed solving. This worked quite well, but since the solution was unknown, it was hard to tie it to the R workshop.\nI emphasise that when thinking about the experiment-to-figure workflow, lab members should consider their analysis and how to make it easier for themselves. For example, when they are at the microscope, naming files is important because they get carried through: to the Fiji step and then into R. Any inconsistencies cause headaches. Again, if this improves lab members work habits, that’s only a good thing.\nThe materials can probably be refined. As they are, they take 90 min to cover and if there’s questions, it can get quite tight. Extending the middle section using an example that requires more calculations would be useful to really show off what R can do, but this would obviously require more time.\n—\nThe post title comes from Get Better by The New Fast Automatic Daffodils.
