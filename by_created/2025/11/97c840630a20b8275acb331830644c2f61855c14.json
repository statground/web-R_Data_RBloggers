This file contains the functions that we want to <strong>export</strong> from C++ to R using Rcpp.</p>\n<p>At the top of the file, we include the main Rcpp header file.

The Rcpp function looks like this.</p>\n<pre>// [[Rcpp::export]]\ndouble bond_price(Rcpp::NumericVector times, Rcpp::NumericVector cashflows, double rate)\n{\n  std::vector&lt;double&gt; _times = Rcpp::as&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;(times);\n  std::vector&lt;double&gt; _cashflows = Rcpp::as&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;(cashflows);\n  \n  double price = FinancialFunctions::Bonds::price(_times, _cashflows, rate);\n \n  return price;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Inside the function, the Rcpp types <code>NumericVector</code> are converted to <code>std::vector&lt;double&gt;</code>, which is what our function expects.</p>\n<p>Finally we call our function and return the result.</p>\n<p>The Rcpp code for <code>bond_ytm</code> is very similar.</p>\n<p>Everything is now ready to be built.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select the menu: Build &gt; Build binary package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep our fingers crossed that we have not made any mistakes. If everything goes okay, we should see a message similar to this:</p>\n<pre>Binary package written to D:/Development/Projects/R\n</pre>\n<p>Copy the contents of the zip file into your R library directory as previously, overwriting the initial version of the package.</p>\n<p>In order to check that everything works as expected, run the following script.</p>\n<pre>library(FinancialFunctions)\n# Example: a 3 year bond with a face value of $100 makes annual coupon \n# payments of 10%.

We can check the results against the manual calculations in a spreadsheet if required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap up.</h3>\n<p>That’s all there is to it. We now have a working Rcpp package that calls C/C++ functions from R.</p>\n<p>But that really is only the beginning. There’s a lot more that can be done. For starters, we could improve the project design by isolating our code in a static library. We could also add some test cases, perhaps using a package like ‘testthat’. Finally, we could add a couple more functions: perhaps bond duration and convexity calculations. I might look at how to do all this in a future article.

These are passed in from R. The function returns a double value, the calculated price. The Rcpp function looks like this.\n// [[Rcpp::export]]\ndouble bond_price(Rcpp::NumericVector times, Rcpp::NumericVector cashflows, double rate)\n{\n  std::vector<double> _times = Rcpp::as<std::vector<double>>(times);\n  std::vector<double> _cashflows = Rcpp::as<std::vector<double>>(cashflows);\n  \n  double price = FinancialFunctions::Bonds::price(_times, _cashflows, rate);\n \n  return price;\n}\nInside the function, the Rcpp types\nNumericVector\nare converted to\nstd::vector<double>\n, which is what our function expects.\nFinally we call our function and return the result.\nThe Rcpp code for\nbond_ytm\nis very similar.\nEverything is now ready to be built.\nSelect the menu: Build > Build binary package.\nKeep our fingers crossed that we have not made any mistakes. If everything goes okay, we should see a message similar to this:\nBinary package written to D:/Development/Projects/R\nCopy the contents of the zip file into your R library directory as previously, overwriting the initial version of the package.\nIn order to check that everything works as expected, run the following script.\nlibrary(FinancialFunctions)\n# Example: a 3 year bond with a face value of $100 makes annual coupon \n# payments of 10%. The current interest rate (with annual compounding) is 9%.\ntimes <- c(1, 2, 3)\ncashflows <- c(10, 10, 110)\nrate <- 0.09\n\n# Calculate price and yield to maturity\nprice <- FinancialFunctions::bond_price(times, cashflows, rate)\nytm <- FinancialFunctions::bond_ytm(times, cashflows, price)\n\n# Display the results\nprice\nytm\nThere should be no errors. We can check the results against the manual calculations in a spreadsheet if required.\nWrap up.\nThat’s all there is to it. We now have a working Rcpp package that calls C/C++ functions from R.\nBut that really is only the beginning. There’s a lot more that can be done. For starters, we could improve the project design by isolating our code in a static library. We could also add some test cases, perhaps using a package like ‘testthat’. Finally, we could add a couple more functions: perhaps bond duration and convexity calculations. I might look at how to do all this in a future article. The complete project is available on GitHub,\nFinancialFunctions\n.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nAdam's Software Lab\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
