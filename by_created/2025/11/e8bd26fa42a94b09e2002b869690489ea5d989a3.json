It ranges from “Our packages need to be vaguely sensible, not compromise our system and have a place where I can log bugs” to “if our packages aren’t thoroughly tested and proven to be fit for purpose, I can’t use them in production”.

Who are the risk seekers? Most of us, at some point or another.

How bad can a package be to be usable? A thought experiment we like to do is “suppose you had an R package, with only one version. It’s never updated, no one has heard from the maintainer in ten years. But it provides code for an algorithm you want to use. What would you do?” The obvious answer for those who have a high risk appetite is “something is better than nothing” and “proceed with caution”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"risk-averse\">Risk Averse</h2>\n<p>There are lots of examples of where we are (and should be) risk-averse when it comes to R packages. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the pharmaceutical industry, we need reassurance that the statistics used in reporting are correct.
