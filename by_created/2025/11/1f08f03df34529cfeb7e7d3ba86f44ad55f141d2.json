The method involves high-resolution tracking of a hand or handheld device (e.g., a computer mouse) while it is used to make a choice. In contrast to other process-tracing methods, which mostly focus on information acquisition, movement tracking focuses on the processes of information integration and preference formation. In this article, we present a tutorial on movement tracking of psychological processes with the mousetrap R package. We address all steps of the research process,from design to interpretation, with a particular focus on data processing and analysis and featuring both established and novel approaches. Using a representative working example, we demonstrate how the various steps of movement-tracking analysis can be implemented with mousetrap and provide thorough explanations of their theoretical background and interpretation. Finally, we present a list of recommendations to assist researchers in addressing their own research questions using movement tracking of psychological processes. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.3758/s13428-025-02695-2?sharing_token=RYRPZHiX1115pv5AVlZ2VZAH0g46feNdnc402WrhzyoPl57fb1b_grQED9bubgIqr9KcF8w15SwVvnQPRpfb6BZBfyub2r5mviZ1efXeYA0oXwi6WWJ0OmgzK-Mwzjz9b1dKX7D8XXknTghfUALmoKLvEF3CRtdE6rbY3nbiRoQ%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[Here]</a> is the paper published in <em>Behavioral Research Methods</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"http://jmbh.github.io//MousetrapTutorial/\"> Jonas Haslbeck - r</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr/>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\n\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\n</div> </div>\n</article>",
