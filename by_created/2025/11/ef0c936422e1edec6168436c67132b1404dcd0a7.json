In <a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>, we looked at what Lighthouse is and how it can be used to assess the start-up times of webpages, and in <a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a>, we used Lighthouse to test Shiny apps and performed some analysis on the <a href=\"https://posit.co/blog/time-to-shiny/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Shiny App Contest</a> submissions. In this final part I am going to create a few Shiny Apps with different content and use Lighthouse to see the differences. I have creatively named my apps app1, app2, …, app6.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-apps\">The Apps</h3>\n<p>The default app (app1) I’m using as baseline is <code>shiny::runExample(\"01_helLo\")</code>, it is just a simple app with a slider input and a histogram, where the slider input dictates the number of histogram bins. It looks like this:</p>\n<img alt=\"Image of the first app. This app contains a histogram and a slider to the left allowing you to select the number of bins in the histogram.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse-part-3/img/app1.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Image of the first app. This app contains a histogram and a slider to the left allowing you to select the number of bins in the histogram.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse-part-3/img/app1.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/></noscript>\n<p>To actually see what factors cause changes in load time, I’m going to be building upon this app incrementally.

In\nPart 1\n, we looked at what Lighthouse is and how it can be used to assess the start-up times of webpages, and in\nPart 2\n, we used Lighthouse to test Shiny apps and performed some analysis on the\n2021 Shiny App Contest\nsubmissions. In this final part I am going to create a few Shiny Apps with different content and use Lighthouse to see the differences. I have creatively named my apps app1, app2, …, app6.\nThe Apps\nThe default app (app1) I’m using as baseline is\nshiny::runExample(\"01_helLo\")\n, it is just a simple app with a slider input and a histogram, where the slider input dictates the number of histogram bins. It looks like this:\nTo actually see what factors cause changes in load time, I’m going to be building upon this app incrementally. So, app2 is identical to the first, apart from we have a\n{plotly} histogram\ninstead of a base\nhist()\nplot.\nFor app3 I am adding a simple data table using\nshiny::renderTable()\non top of the second app. App 3 looks like this:\nThen app4 is the same as the third only we are replacing the data table with a\n{DT} data table\nusing\nDT::renderDT()\nand\nDT::DTOutput()\n.\nFor app5 I have added a date input widget in the sidebar.

This plot gave me a good idea of how to further explore the data.\nTime to Interactive vs Speed Index\nIn this scatter plot of TTI (Time to Interactive – ms) vs SI (Speed Index – ms), we can see the times increasing with each iteration of the app. There is a two-fold difference in TTI between the simplest and the most-complex apps.
