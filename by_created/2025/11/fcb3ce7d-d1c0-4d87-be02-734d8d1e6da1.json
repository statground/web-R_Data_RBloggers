Since our last interview in September 2021, our local meetup group has seen some exciting developments.

The primary goal of the meetup is to meet each other and know what the members want from the group moving forward. We had new members who attended the meetup, and most of our old members also called in to show their support. We discussed the challenges the group and the members face, e.g., attending in-person meetups. I found the event to be a positive experience that will motivate me and others to help improve the groups’ meet-up attendance. A fun suggestion from our members was to involve dancing and more enjoyment in our meetups. </p>\n<p><strong>Who was the target audience for attending this event? </strong></p>\n<p>Our focus is on academics, particularly those in statistics and computer science, which aligns well with our area’s abundance of educational institutions. However, integrating our work with schools has been challenging due to bureaucratic hurdles, making it time-consuming and stressful.</p>\n<p>Despite these obstacles, we’ve made some progress. We managed to have academic participation in our events—for instance, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammed-tahir-muhammed/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Muhammed Tahir Muhammed</a>, a statistics lecturer from our network. We also had a representative from the field of epidemiology named Isaac Joseph, the department director. </p>\n<p>We’re excited about the potential for collaboration with these academics and professionals. At a recent event, we were pleased to see participation from three professionals from different fields, a new record for us. Among them was a lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezehmichael/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Ezeh</a>, who has experience with data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. He’s keen to expand his programming knowledge, starting with R, which is encouraging. We also had the following new members: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fidelisobaniyi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Obaniyi Fidelis</a> (Economics), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mafiana-ifechi-4459ab28/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mafiana Ifechi</a> (Data Analyst), and Benedicta Amarachukwu (New to R Data Analyst).</p>\n<p>We’re running small focus groups as a pilot, which we hope to launch by January. The diverse backgrounds of our attendees are promising, and they will likely attract even more participants to our community.</p>\n<p><strong>Any techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people unable to attend physical events in the future? </strong> </p>\n<p>I recommend Zoom meetings and Github. They are both easy to help regarding collaboration and resource sharing.</p>\n<p><strong>When is your next event? Please give details!</strong></p>\n<p>We will be starting our focus groups in January. We are currently using the remaining days of this year to plan for 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>Please share any additional details you would like included in the blog. </strong></p>\n<p>We’re excited and hopeful that we will be able to impact the community with much more coming next year. We’ll be able to reach out to more people. As shown in our pictures, we have a fun time. I can also say that our numbers on the Meetup group are growing, which makes me happy. </p>\n<p><strong>How do I Join?</strong></p>\n<p>R Consortium’s R User Group and Small Conference Support Program (RUGS) provides grants to help R groups worldwide organize, share information, and support each other. We have given grants over the past four years, encompassing over 65,000 members in 35 countries. We would like to include you! Cash grants and meetup.com accounts are awarded based on the intended use of the funds and the amount of money available to distribute.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/r-user-group-support-program\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a></div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2023/11/28/igniting-innovation-bilikisu-wunmi-olatunjis-journey-with-abujas-thriving-r-user-community\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Igniting Innovation: Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji’s Journey with Abuja’s Thriving R User Community</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.r-consortium.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">R Consortium</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.8.9-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2023/11/28/igniting-innovation-bilikisu-wunmi-olatunjis-journey-with-abujas-thriving-r-user-community\"> R Consortium</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\r\n\r\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\r\n</hr></div> </div>\n</article>",

Among them was a lawyer,\nMichael Ezeh\n, who has experience with data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. He’s keen to expand his programming knowledge, starting with R, which is encouraging. We also had the following new members:\nObaniyi Fidelis\n(Economics),\nMafiana Ifechi\n(Data Analyst), and Benedicta Amarachukwu (New to R Data Analyst).\nWe’re running small focus groups as a pilot, which we hope to launch by January. The diverse backgrounds of our attendees are promising, and they will likely attract even more participants to our community.\nAny techniques you recommend using for planning for or during the event? (Github, zoom, other) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people unable to attend physical events in the future?\nI recommend Zoom meetings and Github. They are both easy to help regarding collaboration and resource sharing.\nWhen is your next event? Please give details!\nWe will be starting our focus groups in January. We are currently using the remaining days of this year to plan for 2024.\nPlease share any additional details you would like included in the blog.\nWe’re excited and hopeful that we will be able to impact the community with much more coming next year. We’ll be able to reach out to more people. As shown in our pictures, we have a fun time. I can also say that our numbers on the Meetup group are growing, which makes me happy.\nHow do I Join?\nR Consortium’s R User Group and Small Conference Support Program (RUGS) provides grants to help R groups worldwide organize, share information, and support each other. We have given grants over the past four years, encompassing over 65,000 members in 35 countries. We would like to include you! Cash grants and meetup.com accounts are awarded based on the intended use of the funds and the amount of money available to distribute.\nLearn more\nThe post\nIgniting Innovation: Bilikisu Wunmi Olatunji’s Journey with Abuja’s Thriving R User Community\nappeared first on\nR Consortium\n.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nR Consortium\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
