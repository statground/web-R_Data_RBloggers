My idea was simple: <i>the functions that one should invest the most effort into learning are precisely those functions that are used most frequently in real world code</i>. In fact, this simple idea can be applied to spoken languages as valuably as to programming languages: the words that will most improve your ability to understand day-to-day speech in a foreign language are precisely the words that occur most frequently in day-to-day speech. Our language classrooms tend to screw this up by emphasizing words like “spoon” over “dude”, even though people my age will use the word “dude” many more times a day than they’ll use “spoon”.<sup>1</sup> In large part, this is because the usefulness of a word tends to be confounded with its respectability when you learn a language in an academic setting. This over-emphasis on respectability is why you’re never taught curse words, even though they’re as practically useful as the majority of other words.</p>\n<p>But I digress. Returning to R, <a href=\"http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/content/data_sets/r_function_frequencies.csv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the attached CSV data set</a> contains the results of my word frequency analysis. To produce this data set, I spidered all of the source code for every R package on CRAN, split the resulting corpus text into lexical tokens, and counted the occurrences of each token. To make things simpler, I decided to treat every token followed by a parenthesized expression as a function, even though this gives me some syntactical units like <code>if</code> in my list of functions.</p>\n<p>I think the resulting raw data set is probably as useful as any summaries I can offer of it, but I’ll offer some obvious results for those interested.</p>\n<p>Function call frequencies in R, unsurprisingly, seem to follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Zipf’s law</a> or some variety thereof.
