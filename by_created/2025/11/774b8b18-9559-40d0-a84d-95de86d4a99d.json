Today’s goal therefore is to run his examples and to see, what problems I run into 🙂<br/><br/>Allright, if you all go to the example section of Charlie’s <a href=\"http://www.stat.umn.edu/~charlie/Sweave/#exam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Reproducible Research Page</a>, you will find three examples. Let’s start with the first one.<br/><br/>To start, I created a folder ReproducibleResearch, copied my Sweave.sty file into it and created a project within Textmate by dragging the folder onto the Textmate icon in my dock. Then I created a document foo.Rnw, copied the contents of the first example into it and saved it (if you have the R, SWeave and LaTeX bundles installed, TextMate should be recognizing this *.Rnw document as a Sweave document.<br/><br/>Feeling lucky, I just pressed cmd-R to run this code in R.<br/><br/>…drumroll…<br/><br/>It just worked. Wow! A TextMate “Sweave, Typeset &amp; View” window just showed me “An (sic!) Sweave Demo” by Charles J. Geyer! Complete with LaTeX typesetting, R output and even graphics. That’s what I want, so this is a great start! Many kudos to Charles.<br/><br/>Now, let’s analyse the code to see what we can rip off this example.<br/><br/><blockquote>\\documentclass{article}<br/><br/>\\usepackage{amsmath}<br/>\\usepackage{amscd}<br/>\\usepackage[tableposition=top]{caption}<br/>\\usepackage{ifthen}<br/>\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}<br/><br/>\\begin{document}<br/><br/>\\title{An Sweave Demo}<br/>\\author{Charles J. Geyer}<br/>\\maketitle</blockquote><br/><br/>All right, so this is just plain LaTeX. It is a document of class article, it uses some packages, it begins the document and defines a title. Doesn’t look pretty in code, but hey, this is LaTeX – you better get used to this 😉<br/><br/><blockquote>This is a demo for using the \\verb@Sweave@ command in R.  To<br/>get started make a regular \\LaTeX\\ file (like this one) but<br/>give it the suffix \\<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"c7b1a2b5a587e995a9b0\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>@ instead of \\<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"98eefdeafad8b6ecfde0\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>@ and then<br/>turn it into a \\LaTeX\\ file (\\<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"fc8a998e9ebc9a9393d2889984\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>@) with the (unix) command<br/>\\begin{verbatim}<br/>R CMD Sweave foo.Rnw<br/>\\end{verbatim}<br/>So you can do<br/>\\begin{verbatim}<br/>latex foo<br/>xdvi foo<br/>\\end{verbatim}<br/>and so forth.</blockquote><br/><br/>Now there is some text – all this \\verb@sometext@ gives you a code-like text formating within normal text. \\begin{verbatim} starts a code block, \\end{verbatim} stops it. Pretty standard LaTeX stuff.<br/><br/>A few lines later it gets more interesting:<br/><blockquote><br/>&lt;<two>&gt;=<br/>2 + 2<br/>@</two></blockquote><br/><br/>Alright, so this is a code chunk, which will be run and the output of R will be written. Very nice! Try it out and alter the 2 + 2 to something else and sweave the file again. I typed in 2 * 1024 – 35 and the result has been 2013.
