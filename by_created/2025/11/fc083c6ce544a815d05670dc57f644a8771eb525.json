This will improve traceability, simplify long-term maintenance, and add the opportunity to utilize tools for automated documentation.</p>\n<h4><strong>Testing and Risk-Based Approaches</strong></h4>\n<p>Testing is integral to GxP validation. Unit tests and integration tests will ensure both individual components and the overall app function correctly. It is useful to apply a risk-based and identify:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><strong>Low-risk components</strong>: Lightweight packages with no data manipulation responsibilities, such as those for UI aesthetics, require minimal validation.</li>\n<li><strong>High-risk components</strong>: Packages or app functionalities that manipulate data or perform statistical analysis require thorough testing and validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This risk-based approach allows you to focus your efforts where they’re most needed.</p>\n<h4><strong>Configuration and Access Management</strong></h4>\n<p>Managing configuration and access is an essential part of app validation. Tools such as the config package help streamline the management of environment variables and secrets by keeping configuration settings separate from the codebase.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Need help with R package validation in pharma? <a href=\"https://www.appsilon.com/post/r-package-validation-in-pharma\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Follow our guide to ensure compliance and build with confidence. </a></p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Rhino for Creating GxP-Validated Shiny Apps</strong></h3>\n<p>We developed and use <a href=\"https://github.com/Appsilon/rhino\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rhino</a>, a tool that enforces best practices and provides a solid foundation for Shiny app development.</p>\n<p>By incorporating community best practices, Rhino reduces the complexity of building and maintaining validated apps.</p>\n<h4><strong>Key Features of Rhino</strong></h4>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><strong>File Structure</strong>: Rhino makes testing and debugging more straightforward as it has a clear separation between business logic and the application code.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on Standards</strong>: Rhino prioritizes the use of community standards.

This will improve traceability, simplify long-term maintenance, and add the opportunity to utilize tools for automated documentation.\nTesting and Risk-Based Approaches\nTesting is integral to GxP validation. Unit tests and integration tests will ensure both individual components and the overall app function correctly. It is useful to apply a risk-based and identify:\nLow-risk components\n: Lightweight packages with no data manipulation responsibilities, such as those for UI aesthetics, require minimal validation.\nHigh-risk components\n: Packages or app functionalities that manipulate data or perform statistical analysis require thorough testing and validation.\nThis risk-based approach allows you to focus your efforts where they’re most needed.\nConfiguration and Access Management\nManaging configuration and access is an essential part of app validation. Tools such as the config package help streamline the management of environment variables and secrets by keeping configuration settings separate from the codebase.\nNeed help with R package validation in pharma?\nFollow our guide to ensure compliance and build with confidence.\nRhino for Creating GxP-Validated Shiny Apps\nWe developed and use\nRhino\n, a tool that enforces best practices and provides a solid foundation for Shiny app development.\nBy incorporating community best practices, Rhino reduces the complexity of building and maintaining validated apps.\nKey Features of Rhino\nFile Structure\n: Rhino makes testing and debugging more straightforward as it has a clear separation between business logic and the application code.\nFocus on Standards\n: Rhino prioritizes the use of community standards. It ensures consistency and makes it easier to collaborate, review, and maintain validated applications.\nIntegrated Development Tools\n: With tools for dependency management and GitHub workflows for automated linting and testing, Rhino simplifies compliance workflows.\nTesting Infrastructure\n: Rhino supports standardized testing, enabling developers to achieve comprehensive test coverage efficiently.\nWant to boost GxP compliance with automated testing?\nDiscover how good testing practices can make all the difference.\nSummary\nIncorporating GxP validation into your Shiny app will simplify processes, establish a shared framework, improve collaboration, and enhance development workflows.\nA tool like\nRhino\n, purpose-built for creating production-grade Shiny apps that follow good software development practices, which in turn make it easier for users to build GxP-validated applications.\nI recommend any team working in regulated industries explore frameworks like Rhino and adopt the best practices I’ve outlined. With the right tools and methodologies, creating compliant, production-grade Shiny apps becomes both achievable and efficient.\nTalk to us today about how we can work together to create Shiny apps that utilize best practices and streamline your GxP and app validation.\nDoes your team have a clear Definition of Done?\nExplore our GxP validation checklist tailored for pharma teams.\nThe post appeared first on appsilon.com/blog/.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nTag: r - Appsilon | Enterprise R Shiny Dashboards\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
