One such circumstance arose recently for a colleague at HP Labs, where they were trying to ascertain “ballpark” MIPS for a processor being used in one of their projects. To avoid divulging any proprietary information, let’s suppose that the modern microprocessor of interest was a 3.0 GHz Xeon Dual Core, such as can be found in an HP ProLiant ML350 server. Their original estimate was 20,000 MIPS. You can find support for this kind of estimate on the web (see e.g., this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second#Timeline_of_instructions_per_second\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">wiki table</a>). But is it believable? Fortunately, my colleague asked me to sanity check their estimate.<br/><br/>The key to resolving this question is to find a <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">bridge</span> (or bridges) between IBM mainframe MIPS and the throughput metrics used for modern microprocessors. In Chap. 7 of <a href=\"http://www.perfdynamics.com/books.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Practical Performance Analyst</a>, I describe how I sized an Amdahl 5995-1400 series mainframe against a Unix SMP box with up to 24-way MIPS (the company) <a href=\"http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/R3000/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">R3000</a> microprocessors. To do this, I found a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">TPS bridge</span> between IBM’s <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/advantages/management/lspr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">LSPR</a> MIPS ratings and throughput measurements from an TP1 database benchmark running ORACLE. Luckily, I was able do this because the Amdahl mainframe also ran a version of Unix (UTS) and therefore it could also run Oracle’s RDBMS. This meant the workloads were the same, to first order. The conclusion there, as I remember it, was something like the R3000 was equivalent to only one-third of an IBM MIP for TP1 database transactions. The reason for that stems from mainframes having separate (channel) processors to handle physical I/O to DASD disks, whereas a Unix SMP is limited to the same processors for executing both user transactions and the device-driver I/Os (kernel code).<br/><br/>Things are less ambiguous if the workload is compute-intensive. The one clear accomplishment of the <a href=\"http://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SPEC benchmark</a> organization is, they have redefined nominal “MIPS” for modern microprocessors (whether or not that was their intention). The relevant industry-standard microprocessor benchmarks are the SPEC CINT (integer-only CPU workloads) and SPEC CFP (floating-point CPU workloads). The current benchmark release is collectively known as SPEC <a href=\"http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CPU2006</a>. <br/><br/>The unfortunate downside is, that up until their 2006 release, it was possible to compare IBM MIPS, Vax VUPs and SPEC CINTs, because they were very similar, to first order. For example, MIPS Corporation rated the R3000 @ 40 MHz = 32 VUPS. The SPEC CINT1992 rating was about 27; very close to the VUPS value. Amdahl Corporation rated the 5995-1400 @ 100 MHz = 120 IBM MIPS. But the Amdahl mainframe was a 4-way SMP. Therefore, each CPU-engine was approximately 30 IBM MIPS and that matches the VUPS rating numerically for cpu-bound workloads. A simple check we can do at this point is simply to wind up the clock (theoretically) to estimate the SPEC rating for the R3000 RISC processor @ 3 GHz; the same clock frequency as the Intel Dual Core processor. Doing this in R, we find:<pre>\n&gt; r&lt;-uniroot(function(x) (40/3000)-(32/x),c(0,5000))\n&gt; r$root\n[1] 2400\n</pre><br/>which suggests that the SPEC rating corresponds to something on the order of 2,000 MIPS; not 20,000 MIPS.<br/><br/>Without getting too sidetracked by all these details, here is a table of SPEC CPU2000 (the previous benchmark release) with CINT metrics for some Intel single and dual core microprocessors:<br/><br/><a data-cf-modified-c1aff1298fc0822cb6c7e0a0-=\"\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-table2.png\" onblur=\"if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"jetpack-lazy-image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-table3.png?w=578&amp;is-pending-load=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-table3.png?w=578\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 176px;\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5321047498148942530\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-table3.png?w=578\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 176px;\"/></noscript></a><br/>If we take it as read that the CINT numbers are close to older MIPS ratings, we get a picture that looks like this:<br/><br/><a data-cf-modified-c1aff1298fc0822cb6c7e0a0-=\"\" href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-plot2.png\" onblur=\"if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"jetpack-lazy-image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-plot3.png?w=578&amp;is-pending-load=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-plot3.png?w=578\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 258px;\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5320636255457292850\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/mips-plot3.png?w=578\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 258px;\"/></noscript></a><br/><br/>In summary, we can conclude:<br/><ul><br/><li> The original guess of 20,000 MIPS appears to be off by an order of magnitude.<br/><li> Mainframe and CISC processors take fewer instructions to do the same work as a RISC processor.<br/><li> If the workload is entirely compute-bound, we may assume IBM MIPS ~ Vax VUPS ~ SPEC CINT2000, to first order.<br/><li> If the workload involves physical I/O, then MIPS estimates should be reduced by factor of 1/2 to 1/3.<br/><li> A 3 GHz core can be safely assumed to be equivalent to 1000-1500 MIPS.<br/><li> Therefore, a 3 GHz dual-core should be roughly equivalent to 2000-3000 MIPS.<br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><br/>What are the important lessons one can take away from this exercise?<ul><br/><li> MIPS, shmips!

A simple check we can do at this point is simply to wind up the clock (theoretically) to estimate the SPEC rating for the R3000 RISC processor @ 3 GHz; the same clock frequency as the Intel Dual Core processor. Doing this in R, we find:\n> r<-uniroot(function(x) (40/3000)-(32/x),c(0,5000))\n> r$root\n[1] 2400\nwhich suggests that the SPEC rating corresponds to something on the order of 2,000 MIPS; not 20,000 MIPS.\nWithout getting too sidetracked by all these details, here is a table of SPEC CPU2000 (the previous benchmark release) with CINT metrics for some Intel single and dual core microprocessors:\nIf we take it as read that the CINT numbers are close to older MIPS ratings, we get a picture that looks like this:\nIn summary, we can conclude:\nThe original guess of 20,000 MIPS appears to be off by an order of magnitude.\nMainframe and CISC processors take fewer instructions to do the same work as a RISC processor.\nIf the workload is entirely compute-bound, we may assume IBM MIPS ~ Vax VUPS ~ SPEC CINT2000, to first order.\nIf the workload involves physical I/O, then MIPS estimates should be reduced by factor of 1/2 to 1/3.\nA 3 GHz core can be safely assumed to be equivalent to 1000-1500 MIPS.\nTherefore, a 3 GHz dual-core should be roughly equivalent to 2000-3000 MIPS.\nWhat are the important lessons one can take away from this exercise?\nMIPS, shmips! It doesn’t really matter what you call it. It’s vernacular for processor throughput performance. It’s not going away, so learn to deal with it.\nTrying to come up with\nsome\nestimate (even if it turns out to be wrong) is better than not having any clue at all.\nWithout an estimate, how are you going to know if you\nare\nwrong?\nNumbers are not the only way, or even the best way, to make estimates. It is often more insightful to use a combination of numerical and graphical techniques.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nTaking the Pith Out of Performance\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nbenchmark\nIBM\nmultiprocessor\noracle\nR\nSPEC",
