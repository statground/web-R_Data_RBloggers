But you can only build the model on customers who <em>were actually granted</em> a loan. You don’t have any information about whether people whose loan application was declined would have defaulted or not! In other words, you want to apply the model to the population of all people who come “through the door” of the bank, but you only have data on people who were judged to be good credit risks. Hence the name “through the door problem”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example\">Example</h2>\n<p>Just to illustrate what can happen, suppose we want to build a retail credit scoring model and we have a data set with one numerical feature <code>x1</code> (which could be a transformed version of something like age) and one categorical feature <code>x2</code> (which could be something like whether the person has defulted before). Consider two alternatives, one where we have access to all the data and one where we apply a scorecard which rejects all applicants with <code>x1 + x2 &gt; 0</code> and we only have data for applicants who were not rejected.</p>\n<pre>set.seed(100)\n\nlogit &lt;- function(x) 1/(1+exp(-x))\n\nsimulate_data &lt;- function(n){\n  x1 &lt;- rnorm(n)/2 # continuous feature\n  x2 &lt;- rep(c(1, 0), n)[1:n] # categorical feature\n  PD &lt;- logit(-3 + x1 + x2) # true PD\n  y &lt;- rbinom(1000, 1, prob=PD) # simulated defaults\n  data.frame(cbind(x1, x2, y))\n}\n\n# simulated data\ndat &lt;- simulate_data(1000)\n</pre>\n<p>Build two models, one on an unbiased sample and one on a through-the-door sample.</p>\n<pre># logistic regression based on part of full data set\nmodel &lt;- glm(y ~. , data=dat[1:250, ], family=\"binomial\")\n\n# censored data, assuming all applications with x1 + x2 &gt;= 0 rejected\nthresh &lt;- 0\nttd &lt;- dat[dat$x1 + dat$x2 &lt; thresh, ]\n\n# model built on through-the-door data\nmodel_ttd &lt;- glm(y ~. , data=ttd, family=\"binomial\")\n</pre>\n<p>It’s customary to use AUC to compare models because it’s more important to have a ranking of loans rather than a direct estimate of the probability of default.

You still have data about rejected loan applicants, so the most basic idea is to assume that all those applicants defaulted.</p>\n<p>In our example, we can throw in a sample of 100 rejected loan applicants, assume that they all default, and add them to the <code>ttd</code> data set.</p>\n<pre>u &lt;- dat[sample(which(dat$x1 + dat$x2 &gt;= thresh), 100),]\nu$y &lt;- 1\nttd2 &lt;- rbind(ttd, u)\n\n# model with reject inference\nmodel_ttd2 &lt;- glm(y ~. , data=ttd2, family=\"binomial\")\n</pre>\n<div style=\"width:70%; margin: 0 auto\">\n<img data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/datascienceconfidential.github.io/blog/images/2025/roc_curves_ttd_2.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/datascienceconfidential.github.io/blog/images/2025/roc_curves_ttd_2.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript>\n</div>\n<p>In this simple example, this fixes the problem. Real life is more complicated, of course, and there are <a href=\"https://riskspan.com/reject-inference-methods-in-credit-modeling/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">various approaches to reject inference</a>. The least cost-effective is just automatically approving some <em>randomly</em>-chosen subset of loans in order to get an unbiased data set which doesn’t suffer from rejection issues. Of course, this means that you end up approving some bad borrowers, which can be costly in the long run.</p>\n<h1 id=\"does-it-arise-in-other-fields\">Does it arise in other fields?</h1>\n<p>There are other versions of the through-the-door problem. One amusing example is ancient credit risk data. According to <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/448594/the-price-of-time-by-chancellor-edward/9781802060157\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Price of Time</a> by Edward Chancellor, Babylonian loans were recorded on clay tablets which were destroyed when the loan was fully repaid. Therefore, if you were trying to build a credit scorecard for ancient Babylon, your data set would consist entirely of defaulters!</p>\n<p>What about applications outside credit risk? Well, surprisingly, this sort of thing comes up quite often. One <a href=\"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/661353/training-ml-models-where-sampling-process-selects-likely-positives-the-health-i/661356#661356\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recent question on Crossvalidated</a> asks about health inspections. A health inspector wants to gather data on restaurants, but also wants to find restaurants which are likely to be violating health rules. Naturally this leads to a data set which is biased towards restaurants which are likely to be violators. This is exactly like the through-the-door problem except that the training data for your health inspection model will be biased towards “bads” rather than “goods”. You can build a machine learning model on this data but when you try to apply your model in the real world, you might get a nasty surprise!</p>\n<p>In fact, this sort of thing happens all the time, and is a key reason why many predictive models fail. It’s always important to understand exactly how the data were collected. If the training and test data don’t come from the same population, then estimates of model performance are going to be wrong. And (unless you’re on Kaggle) the training and test data <em>never</em> come from the same population. That’s one reason why I prefer to evaluate models on out-of-time samples rather than relying on cross-validation!</p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"https://datascienceconfidential.github.io/statistics/economics/r/2025/07/10/paradoxes-in-credit-risk-II.html\"> datascienceconfidential - r</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr/>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\n\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\n</div> </div>\n</article>",

Consider two alternatives, one where we have access to all the data and one where we apply a scorecard which rejects all applicants with\nx1 + x2 > 0\nand we only have data for applicants who were not rejected.\nset.seed(100)\n\nlogit <- function(x) 1/(1+exp(-x))\n\nsimulate_data <- function(n){\n  x1 <- rnorm(n)/2 # continuous feature\n  x2 <- rep(c(1, 0), n)[1:n] # categorical feature\n  PD <- logit(-3 + x1 + x2) # true PD\n  y <- rbinom(1000, 1, prob=PD) # simulated defaults\n  data.frame(cbind(x1, x2, y))\n}\n\n# simulated data\ndat <- simulate_data(1000)\nBuild two models, one on an unbiased sample and one on a through-the-door sample.\n# logistic regression based on part of full data set\nmodel <- glm(y ~. , data=dat[1:250, ], family=\"binomial\")\n\n# censored data, assuming all applications with x1 + x2 >= 0 rejected\nthresh <- 0\nttd <- dat[dat$x1 + dat$x2 < thresh, ]\n\n# model built on through-the-door data\nmodel_ttd <- glm(y ~. , data=ttd, family=\"binomial\")\nIt’s customary to use AUC to compare models because it’s more important to have a ranking of loans rather than a direct estimate of the probability of default. Here are the ROC curves of the two models.\nlibrary(ROCR)\npred_model <- prediction(pred, dat_test$y)\nperf <- performance(pred_model,\"tpr\",\"fpr\")\n\npng(\"roc_curves_ttd.png\", width=500, height=500)\nplot(\n[email protected]\n[[1]],\n[email protected]\n[[1]], \"l\",\n     xlab=\"fpr\", ylab=\"tpr\", las=1)\n\npred_model_ttd <- prediction(pred_ttd, dat_test$y)\nperf_ttd <- performance(pred_model_ttd,\"tpr\",\"fpr\")\nlines(\n[email protected]\n[[1]],\n[email protected]\n[[1]], col=\"red\")\n\nlegend(\"topleft\", lty=c(1,1), col=c(\"black\", \"red\"), legend=c(\"full sample\",\n                                                  \"ttd sample\"))\nClearly the model’s performance degrades when it’s fitted to the through-the-door sample. Note that this doesn’t always happen. Here are some ROC curves we get by running the whole process with a few different random seeds.\nWhat to do about it?\nCredit risk modellers have developed a family of techniques and rules of thumb called\nreject inference\nto deal with these issues. You still have data about rejected loan applicants, so the most basic idea is to assume that all those applicants defaulted.\nIn our example, we can throw in a sample of 100 rejected loan applicants, assume that they all default, and add them to the\nttd\ndata set.\nu <- dat[sample(which(dat$x1 + dat$x2 >= thresh), 100),]\nu$y <- 1\nttd2 <- rbind(ttd, u)\n\n# model with reject inference\nmodel_ttd2 <- glm(y ~. , data=ttd2, family=\"binomial\")\nIn this simple example, this fixes the problem. Real life is more complicated, of course, and there are\nvarious approaches to reject inference\n. The least cost-effective is just automatically approving some\nrandomly\n-chosen subset of loans in order to get an unbiased data set which doesn’t suffer from rejection issues. Of course, this means that you end up approving some bad borrowers, which can be costly in the long run.\nDoes it arise in other fields?\nThere are other versions of the through-the-door problem. One amusing example is ancient credit risk data. According to\nThe Price of Time\nby Edward Chancellor, Babylonian loans were recorded on clay tablets which were destroyed when the loan was fully repaid. Therefore, if you were trying to build a credit scorecard for ancient Babylon, your data set would consist entirely of defaulters!\nWhat about applications outside credit risk? Well, surprisingly, this sort of thing comes up quite often. One\nrecent question on Crossvalidated\nasks about health inspections. A health inspector wants to gather data on restaurants, but also wants to find restaurants which are likely to be violating health rules. Naturally this leads to a data set which is biased towards restaurants which are likely to be violators. This is exactly like the through-the-door problem except that the training data for your health inspection model will be biased towards “bads” rather than “goods”. You can build a machine learning model on this data but when you try to apply your model in the real world, you might get a nasty surprise!\nIn fact, this sort of thing happens all the time, and is a key reason why many predictive models fail. It’s always important to understand exactly how the data were collected. If the training and test data don’t come from the same population, then estimates of model performance are going to be wrong. And (unless you’re on Kaggle) the training and test data\nnever\ncome from the same population. That’s one reason why I prefer to evaluate models on out-of-time samples rather than relying on cross-validation!\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\ndatascienceconfidential - r\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
