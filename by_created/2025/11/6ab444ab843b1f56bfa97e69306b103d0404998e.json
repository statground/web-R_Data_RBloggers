Our first example calls cut with the <b>breaks</b> argument set to a single number.  This method will cause <b>cut</b> to break up age into 4 intervals.  The default labels use standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Notations_for_intervals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">mathematical notation</a> for open and closed intervals.\n</p>\n<pre>\n\n&gt; ## basic usage of cut with a numeric variable\n&gt; c1 &lt;- cut(clinical.trial$age, breaks = 4)\n&gt; table(c1)\nc1\n  (41.1,50]   (50,58.8] (58.8,67.6] (67.6,76.4] \n          9          34          41          16  \n&gt; ## year.enroll is a factor, so must convert to numeric first!\n&gt; c2 &lt;- cut(as.numeric(as.character(clinical.trial$year.enroll)),\n            breaks = 3)\n&gt; table(c2)\nc2\n(1985,1990] (1990,1994] (1994,1999] \n         36          34          30  \n\n</pre>\n<p>\nWell, the intervals that <b>cut</b> chose by default are not the nicest looking with the age example, although they are fine with the year example, since it was already discrete. Luckily, we can specify the exact intervals we want for age.  Our next example shows how. \n</p>\n<pre>\n\n&gt; ## specify break points explicitly using seq function\n&gt; \n&gt; ## look what seq does  \n&gt; seq(30, 80, by = 10)\n[1] 30 40 50 60 70 80 \n&gt; ## cut the age variable using the seq defined above\n&gt; c1 &lt;- cut(clinical.trial$age, breaks = seq(30, 80, by = 10))\n&gt; ## table of the resulting factor           \n&gt; table(c1)\nc1\n(30,40] (40,50] (50,60] (60,70] (70,80] \n      0       9      40      42       9  \n\n</pre>\n<p>\nThat looks pretty good.  There is no reason that the breaks argument has to be equally spaced as I have done above.  It could be any grouping that you want. \n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, I am going to show you an example of a custom R function to categorize ages.  It uses <b>cut</b> inside of it, but does some preprocessing and uses the <b>labels</b> argument to cut to make the output look nice.  \n</p>\n<pre>\nage.cat &lt;- function(x, lower = 0, upper, by = 10,\n                   sep = \"-\", above.char = \"+\") {\n\n labs &lt;- c(paste(seq(lower, upper - by, by = by),\n                 seq(lower + by - 1, upper - 1, by = by),\n                 sep = sep),\n           paste(upper, above.char, sep = \"\"))\n\n cut(floor(x), breaks = c(seq(lower, upper, by = by), Inf),\n     right = FALSE, labels = labs)\n}\n</pre>\n<p>\nThis function categorizes age in a fairly flexible way.  The first assignment to <b>labs</b> inside the function creates a vector of labels. Then, the <b>cut</b> function is called to do the work, with the custom labels as an argument.  Here are some examples using our simulated data from above. I am no longer going to save the results of the function calls to a variable and call <b>table</b> on them, but rather just nest the call to <b>age.cat</b> in a call to <b>table</b>. I previously did a post on the <a href=\"http://blogisticreflections.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/r-function-of-the-day-table/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">table</a> function. \n</p>\n<pre>\n\n&gt; ## only specifying an upper bound, uses 0 as lower bound, and\n&gt; ## breaks up categories by 10\n&gt; table(age.cat(clinical.trial$age, upper = 70))\n  0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69   70+ \n    0     0     0     0     9    40    42     9  \n&gt; ## now specifying a lower bound\n&gt; table(age.cat(clinical.trial$age, lower = 30, upper = 70))\n30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69   70+ \n    0     9    40    42     9  \n&gt; ## now specifying a lower bound AND the \"by\" argument \n&gt; table(age.cat(clinical.trial$age, lower = 30, upper = 70, by = 5))\n30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65-69   70+ \n    0     0     3     6    22    18    22    20     9  \n\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"outline-3\" id=\"outline-container-1.3\">\n<h3 id=\"sec-1.3\">Summary of cut </h3>\n<div id=\"text-1.3\">\n<p>\nThe cut function is useful for turning continuous variables into factors.

Here are some examples using our simulated data from above. I am no longer going to save the results of the function calls to a variable and call\ntable\non them, but rather just nest the call to\nage.cat\nin a call to\ntable\n. I previously did a post on the\ntable\nfunction.\n> ## only specifying an upper bound, uses 0 as lower bound, and\n> ## breaks up categories by 10\n> table(age.cat(clinical.trial$age, upper = 70))\n  0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69   70+ \n    0     0     0     0     9    40    42     9  \n> ## now specifying a lower bound\n> table(age.cat(clinical.trial$age, lower = 30, upper = 70))\n30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69   70+ \n    0     9    40    42     9  \n> ## now specifying a lower bound AND the \"by\" argument \n> table(age.cat(clinical.trial$age, lower = 30, upper = 70, by = 5))\n30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65-69   70+ \n    0     0     3     6    22    18    22    20     9\nSummary of cut\nThe cut function is useful for turning continuous variables into factors.  You saw how to specify the number of cutpoints, specify the exact cutpoints, and saw a function built around\ncut\nthat simplifies  categorizing an age variable and giving it appropriate labels.\nTags:\nR\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nsigmafield - R\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
