As part of tonight’s meeting I will be providing a <a href=\"http://www.drewconway.com/zia/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ggplot2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">very brief show and tell</a>, which includes mostly code examples and external resources.  This exercise has had me thinking quite a bit about data visualization.  In addition, a few days ago the <a href=\"http://securitycrank.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Security Crank</a> (great new blog) <a href=\"http://securitycrank.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/maps/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pinged me on the apparent uselessness of network analysis visualizations</a> in the defense and intelligence communities.  As I say in <a href=\"http://securitycrank.wordpress.com/2009/11/26/maps/#comment-13\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">my comment at SC</a>, I agree; however, only in that the method is abused by those that view it as only a means to generate “pretty pictures.”  All of this has touched off a very important point about data analysis; possibly the most important, which is how best to convey an analysis visually.</p>\n<p>Consumers of data analytics are very rarely analysts themselves, so those in the business of generating plots, figures, chats, graphs, etc. most not only be expert in the analytical process, but also in choosing the best format and medium for relaying that knowledge to an audience.  Admittedly, I am not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Edward Tufte</a>, <a href=\"http://benfry.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Fry</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">David McCandless</a>, but I have been around long enough to know what does and does not work, and as such here (in no particular order) are my five rules for data visualization.<span id=\"more-1582\"></span>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The viz must be able to stand alone</strong><br/>This I learned early, after being dressed down multiple times while giving briefings to senior intelligence officers.  Since then it has been reinforced while sitting in on failed job talks and conference presentations.  The important thing to keep n mind is that when an audience sees a visualization it should be providing answers, not generating more questions.</li></ol></p>\n<p>This, to me, is the most difficult aspect of creating high quality data visualizations.  As the creators we are often intimately familiar with the data,  and thus take its subtleties for granted.  Some people recommend asking yourself “would my Grandmother understand this,” but why insult Grandma’s intelligence?  Here’s the bottom line: you have to decide the most efficient means of plotting the data (we’ll get to this), then you have a chart title, legend, possibly some axis labels, and if you are bold a short (140 characters is a good limit) footnote to get your point across.  The best visualizations only require a subset of these to be effective, but once you have added the appropriate data accoutrements the chart better be self-explanatory.  Very simple and imperfect example: restaurant tipping trends between men and women.</p>\n<p><center><br/>\n<table>\n<td>\n<tr><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex11.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"jetpack-lazy-image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex11.png?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex11.png?w=250&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"/><noscript><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex11.png?w=250&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></a></tr>\n<tr><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex21.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"jetpack-lazy-image\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex21.png?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex21.png?w=250&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"/><noscript><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/by_sex21.png?w=250&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></a></tr>\n</td>\n</table>\n<p></p></center></p>\n<p>Why is the chart on the right better? First, it has more explanatory value.  By splitting the data into two parts we are able to see the x-axis shift for men, i.e., in general they are tipping on higher bills.  Also, we are able to use color in a more valuable way; rather than using it to distinguish between sex we can use it to highlight outliers and note general trends.  Next, by reducing the amount of data in each plot the information is conveyed more efficiently.  Finally, it achieves our ultimate goal, which is always to provide more answers than questions.\n\n<li><strong>Have a diverse tool set</strong><br/>Learning the quirks and syntax of various data visualizations tools is time consuming and often frustrating, but if you want to create impressive charts you have to do it.  I am very sorry to report, but Microsoft Excel + PowerPoint do not generate the best data visualizations.  In fact, they often generate visualizations in the 10-20th percentile of quality.  The question; therefore is: how do you find the best tools for your task?\n<p>Most of us will not have the resources to use <a href=\"http://spotfire.tibco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">professional data visualizations suites</a>, but even so these tools are often limited by the scope and vision of their creators.  Explore the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualization_%28computer_graphics%29#External_links\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">open-source and general purpose data visualization options</a> out there, learn the three best that fit your needs, and always be open to learning the new stuff—it will pay off.</p></li>\n<li><strong>People are terrible at distinguishing small differences</strong><br/>This could also be described as the “<a href=\"http://www.cerebralmastication.com/?p=304&amp;cpage=1#comment-183\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pie chart trap</a>,” but clearly goes beyond that particular chart design.  In fact, network visualizations are notorious for blurring subtle differences.

    "main_text": "My Five Rules for Data Visualization\nPosted on\nDecember 3, 2009\nby\nDrew Conway\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nZero Intelligence Agents » R\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nTonight the\nNYC R Meetup\nwill be discussing\ndata visualization in R\nusing\nggplot2\n.  As part of tonight’s meeting I will be providing a\nvery brief show and tell\n, which includes mostly code examples and external resources.  This exercise has had me thinking quite a bit about data visualization.  In addition, a few days ago the\nSecurity Crank\n(great new blog)\npinged me on the apparent uselessness of network analysis visualizations\nin the defense and intelligence communities.  As I say in\nmy comment at SC\n, I agree; however, only in that the method is abused by those that view it as only a means to generate “pretty pictures.”  All of this has touched off a very important point about data analysis; possibly the most important, which is how best to convey an analysis visually.\nConsumers of data analytics are very rarely analysts themselves, so those in the business of generating plots, figures, chats, graphs, etc. most not only be expert in the analytical process, but also in choosing the best format and medium for relaying that knowledge to an audience.  Admittedly, I am not\nEdward Tufte\n,\nBen Fry\n, or\nDavid McCandless\n, but I have been around long enough to know what does and does not work, and as such here (in no particular order) are my five rules for data visualization.\nThe viz must be able to stand alone\nThis I learned early, after being dressed down multiple times while giving briefings to senior intelligence officers.  Since then it has been reinforced while sitting in on failed job talks and conference presentations.  The important thing to keep n mind is that when an audience sees a visualization it should be providing answers, not generating more questions.\nThis, to me, is the most difficult aspect of creating high quality data visualizations.  As the creators we are often intimately familiar with the data,  and thus take its subtleties for granted.  Some people recommend asking yourself “would my Grandmother understand this,” but why insult Grandma’s intelligence?  Here’s the bottom line: you have to decide the most efficient means of plotting the data (we’ll get to this), then you have a chart title, legend, possibly some axis labels, and if you are bold a short (140 characters is a good limit) footnote to get your point across.  The best visualizations only require a subset of these to be effective, but once you have added the appropriate data accoutrements the chart better be self-explanatory.  Very simple and imperfect example: restaurant tipping trends between men and women.\nWhy is the chart on the right better? First, it has more explanatory value.  By splitting the data into two parts we are able to see the x-axis shift for men, i.e., in general they are tipping on higher bills.  Also, we are able to use color in a more valuable way; rather than using it to distinguish between sex we can use it to highlight outliers and note general trends.  Next, by reducing the amount of data in each plot the information is conveyed more efficiently.  Finally, it achieves our ultimate goal, which is always to provide more answers than questions.\nHave a diverse tool set\nLearning the quirks and syntax of various data visualizations tools is time consuming and often frustrating, but if you want to create impressive charts you have to do it.  I am very sorry to report, but Microsoft Excel + PowerPoint do not generate the best data visualizations.  In fact, they often generate visualizations in the 10-20th percentile of quality.  The question; therefore is: how do you find the best tools for your task?\nMost of us will not have the resources to use\nprofessional data visualizations suites\n, but even so these tools are often limited by the scope and vision of their creators.  Explore the\nopen-source and general purpose data visualization options\nout there, learn the three best that fit your needs, and always be open to learning the new stuff—it will pay off.\nPeople are terrible at distinguishing small differences\nThis could also be described as the “\npie chart trap\n,” but clearly goes beyond that particular chart design.  In fact, network visualizations are notorious for blurring subtle differences.  For example, visualizations of massive amounts of social network data can be beautiful, but in nearly all cases they are\nmuch more art than science\n.  If we are interested in telling a story with our data, and our data is large and complex, then we need to be creative about how to parse that complexity in order to enhance the clarity of our story.  Example using networks: the structure of venture capital co-investments\nThe visualizations above examine the same data, and even use a similar  technique to visualize it, but clearly the example on the right is conveying a more informative story.
