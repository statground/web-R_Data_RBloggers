You are running an experiment in which you would like participants to tell you what they believe.

Are you going to leave yourself exposed to the slings and arrows of experimental economists? You need to give your participants an incentive to tell you what they really believe, right?</p>\n<p>Enter the scoring rule. You pay off the subjects based on the accuracy of the probabilities they state. You do this by observing some outcome (let’s say “rain”) and you pay a lot of money to the people who assigned a high probability to it raining and you pay a little money (or even impose a fine upon) those who assigned a low probability to it raining. A so-called “proper” scoring rule is one in which people will do the best for themselves if they state what they truly believe to be the case.</p>\n<p>Three popular proper scoring rules are the Spherical, Quadratic, and Logarithmic. Let’s see how they work.</p>\n<p>Suppose in your experimental task you give people the title of a movie, and they have to guess what year the movie was released.  You tell them at the outset that the movie was released between 1980 and 1999: that’s 20 years. So you have these 20 categories (years) and you want people to assign a probability to each year. Afterwards, you will pay them out based on the actual year the movie was released and the probability they assigned to that year.</p>\n<p>Let r be the vector of 20 probabilities, and r_1 could be the probability they assign to 1980 being the year of release, and r_2 the probability that it was 1981, so on through r_20 for 1999′s probability. Naturally, all the r’s add up to one, as probabilities like to do. Now, let r_i be the probability they assign to the year which turns out to be correct.</p>\n<p>Under the Spherical scoring rule, their payout would be r_i / (r*r)^.5</p>\n<p>Under the Quadratic scoring rule, the payout would be 2*r_i – r*r</p>\n<p>Under the Logarithmic scoring rule, the payout would be ln(r_i)</p>\n<p>In the movie above, the top row shows various sets of probabilities someone might assign to the 20 years. (Imagine the categories along the x-axis are the years 1980 to 1999).  Each bar in the graphs in the bottom three rows shows the person’s payout if that year turns out to be correct, based on the probabilities assigned to each year in the top row.</p>\n<p>As you can see, when they assign a high probability to a category and it turns out to be correct, their payout is high. When they assign a low payout to a category and it turns out to be correct, their payout is low.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice that the Logarithmic scoring rule goes right off the bottom of the page.

This means, of course, that if you assign a probability of 0 to alternative “B” and alternative “B” turns out to be correct, your score on that question is negative infinity.
