Thus, for correlations and regressions it makes no difference whether you use the mean or sum of items. I prefer to use the mean of item scores because the interpretation of a mean is clearer than a sum (e.g., telling a manager that the mean satisfaction of a particular employee was 1.3 on a 1 (highly dissatisfied) to 5 (highly satisfied) scale with 7 items seems clearer than telling them that the employee’s score was 9 out of 35).

The SUM function is generally a bad idea as it will return a sum for people with missing data. The functions involving the mean are simple to implement. The 3 after the SUM and MEAN functions specifies that a participant must have data available for at least 3 of the 3 items in order to return a non-missing value. If you have missing data, you may wish to read this tutorial from\nUCLA\n.\nImplementing in R\ncheck out the\nscore.items function\nin the psych package in R.\nHere’s the above example assuming that the data frame is stored in a variable called “x”:\nitems <- c(\"attitude3\", \"attitude6\", \"attitude8\")\nscaleKey <- c(1,1,1)\nlibrary(psych)\nresults <- score.items(keys = scaleKey, items = x[items], \n  totals = FALSE, missing = FALSE, min = 1, \n                max = 7)\n\nresults # Print the results (i.e., reliability and more)\nresults$score # Extract the actual total score\nAdditional useful features of the function:\nThe function can also handle item reversal internally by specifying -1 in the key. A 0 can be used to represent items that are not used.\nit can compute multiple scale scores at once on a set of items\nit can impute the mean or median\nif the totals argument equals TRUE, the function returns the sum, as opposed to the mean.\nThe additional information on reliability and correlations between scales that is returned by the function is relevant both to characterising the scale and checking that it was formed correctly.\nAdditional Resources:\nAnother example of using sum in SPSS.\nBasic web resource on creating a Likert format summative scale\nJamie DeCoster has a good introduction to a range of issues in scale construction from item development to use of statistical software\nAnd Here's an example of SPSS Syntax for when a large number of items need to be reversed before computing scale scores.\nNotes:\nThe example is a 50 item personality test with five factors and which has many items requiring reversal.\nThe variable\nxMultiplier\nstores whether the item should be reversed. Items are consecutive list of\n1\ns and\n-1\ns. A 1 indicates that the item should NOT be reversed. A\n-1\nindicates that the item should be reversed.\nThe raw variables for the items are called\nipip1 to ipip50\n.\nThe new set of variables are called\nipipReversed1 to ipipReversed5\n0\n. These variables will store the new values for the items after reversal. If the item does not need to be reversed, the item will simply be a copy. This tends to be a more manageable solution than simply creating copies of reversed items\nThe reversed set of items is also suitable for inclusion in a reliability analysis (for more information, see the\nsection of this post on reliability analysis\n).\nTo modify this syntax to apply to your own example, the following things would need to be changed:\nipip1 to ipip50\nwould need to be the first and last variable of your data. ip\nipReversed1 to ipipReversed50\nwould need to be the names of the new reversed set of items, and the sequence of\n1\ns and -\n1\ns would need to indicate whether an item needs to be reversed or not. If you did not have a 5 point Likert scale, the code\n6 - x\n, would need to be changed. The subsequent compute syntax would also need to be changed to represent your scale names and the the items that are in each scale.\nDO REPEAT x = ipip1 to ipip50 /\n     xReversed = ipipReversed1 to ipipReversed50 /\n  xMultiplier = 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 \n                1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 \n                1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 -1 \n                1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 \n                1 1 1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1 1.\ncompute xReversed = x.\nif (xMultiplier = -1) xReversed = 6 - x.\nEND REPEAT.\nEXECUTE .\n\n*compute mean scores.\nCOMPUTE ipipReversedExtraversionMean = mean(ipipReversed1, ipipReversed6, ipipReversed11, ipipReversed16, ipipReversed21, ipipReversed26, ipipReversed31, ipipReversed36, ipipReversed41, ipipReversed46).\nCOMPUTE ipipReversedEmotionalStabilityMean = mean(ipipReversed4, ipipReversed9, ipipReversed14, ipipReversed19, ipipReversed24, ipipReversed29, ipipReversed34, ipipReversed39, ipipReversed44, ipipReversed49).\nCOMPUTE ipipReversedAgreeablenessMean = mean(ipipReversed2, ipipReversed7, ipipReversed12, ipipReversed17, ipipReversed22, ipipReversed27, ipipReversed32, ipipReversed37, ipipReversed42, ipipReversed47).\nCOMPUTE ipipReversedConscientiousnessMean = mean(ipipReversed3, ipipReversed8, ipipReversed13, ipipReversed18, ipipReversed23, ipipReversed28, ipipReversed33, ipipReversed38, ipipReversed43, ipipReversed48).\nCOMPUTE ipipReversedOpennessMean = mean(ipipReversed5, ipipReversed10, ipipReversed15, ipipReversed20, ipipReversed25, ipipReversed30, ipipReversed35, ipipReversed40, ipipReversed45, ipipReversed50).\nEXECUTE.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nJeromy Anglim's Blog: Psychology and Statistics\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
