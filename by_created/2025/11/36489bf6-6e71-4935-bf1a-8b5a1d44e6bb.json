Back in 2023, I was trying to speed-up a code I wrote to conduct a General Equilibrium Pseudo Poisson Maximum Likelihood (GEPPML) simulation. After checking each part of the code –which consisted in multiple linear algebra operations– and implementing changes to avoid inefficiencies such as rewriting objects, using for loops instead of <code>mapply()</code>, using a double for loop instead of the <code>outer()</code> function and similars it was clear that C++ could be a better option in terms of speed.</p>\n<p>Having used RcppArmadillo previously, I asked a reasonble question on Stackoverflow only to receive negative comments such as “you are dumb” and others in the same line, I started reading about a new R package called cpp11 which was created as an alternative to Rcpp. Once again, I went back to Stackoverflow when another user wrote “go cry somewhere else” to my question.</p>\n<p>After looking for online resources that could help me with my questions, I started looking for online tutors and I could not find a person with experience in C++ and a reasonable grasp of linear algebra.

The key is:\nDon’t panic and always know where your towel is\nOnce you can confidently write C++ code you should start thinking about R and C++ integration using the cpp11 package or cpp11armadillo. If you have experience creating R packages, perhaps you can start with R and C++ integration with simple examples.\nI once struggled building a simple program as the example I showed in this post but then I went crying somewhere else as the Stackoverflow user said, I asked Prof. Emara lots of questions, searched YouTube videos and started thinking about how to rewrite my own R codes using C++.\nSince then, I published four scientific articles with a strong software component where I used C++ to solve a problem:\nVargas Sepúlveda, Mauricio. 2025. “Capybara: Efficient Estimation of Generalized Linear Models with High-Dimensional Fixed Effects.”\nPLOS ONE\nPublicly available on 2025-08-25.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331178\n.\nVargas Sepúlveda, Mauricio. 2025. “Kendallknight: An R Package for Efficient Implementation of Kendall’s Correlation Coefficient Computation.”\nPLOS ONE\n20 (6): e0326090.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326090\n.\nVargas Sepúlveda, Mauricio and Schneider Malamud, Jonathan. 2025. “cpp11armadillo: An R package to use the Armadillo C++ library.”\nSoftwareX\n30 (May): 102087.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2025.102087\n.\nVargas Sepúlveda, Mauricio and Barkai, Lital. 2025. “The REDATAM format and its challenges for data access and information creation in public policy.”\nData & Policy\n7 (January): e18.\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/dap.2025.4\n.\nI hope this is useful 🙂\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\npacha.dev/blog\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
