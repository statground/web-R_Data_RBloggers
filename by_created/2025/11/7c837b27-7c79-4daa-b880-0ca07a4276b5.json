Although it’s only one function, it gives you so much control over your final plot. <code>theme()</code> allows us to generate a consistent, in-house style for our graphics, modify the text within our plots and more. Getting comfortable with <code>theme()</code> will really take your {ggplot2} skills up a notch.</p>\n<p>Normally, when people want help with an R function I tell them to use the built-in documentation about the function. This is normally done by typing <code>?function_name</code> into the console.

For example, <code>theme_classic()</code> or <code>theme_light()</code>.

There’s still some things that I don’t like. For example, I don’t like having my legend at the side of the plot and I don’t like the grid lines. We can modify these with <code>theme()</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"our-first-theme-modification\">Our first theme() modification</h3>\n<p>The first thing I like to do is move the legend to the bottom of the plot. This is where we start to use the <code>theme()</code> function to modify our plot appearance.

The other options here would be <code>\"top\"</code>, <code>\"left\"</code> or <code>\"right\"</code> to modify the position, or <code>\"none\"</code> to remove the legend entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"id-like-to-you-meet-my-friends-the-element_-functions\">I’d like to you meet my friends: the element_*() functions</h3>\n<p>Most arguments of the <code>theme()</code> function don’t take simple values like character or numeric values as arguments. A large number of the arguments take in a list of a specific class, where the list elements describe what the plot looks like. We can generate this list via an <code>element_*()</code> function. The functions are <code>element_blank()</code>, <code>element_rect()</code>, <code>element_line()</code>, <code>element_text()</code>. Each of these functions has arguments which modify a given feature of our plot. I’ll run you through how each of the <code>element_*()</code> functions might be used, but remember just like any other function <code>?element_*()</code> will show you more</p>\n<h4 id=\"modifying-line-elements\">Modifying line elements</h4>\n<p>Now our plot doesn’t have any lines on to indicate where the axes are. Suppose I want to make it clear where the axis lines are. Because these are, well, <em>lines</em>, I can use <code>element_line()</code> to include them as so:</p>\n<pre>plot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\")\n )\n</pre><p>obviously we all have different favourite colours, use whatever you like. Neutral colours (probably just shades of grey) are probably best for anything professional or for publication.</p>\n<img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom) but grey lines to make the x and y axes clear have been added.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/axis.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom) but grey lines to make the x and y axes clear have been added.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/axis.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/></noscript>\n<p>So here we’ve specified the colour of the line element which corresponds to <code>axis.line</code>. We can change other characteristics here like <code>linewidth</code> or <code>linetype</code>, but I’ll leave that for you to experiment with later.</p>\n<h4 id=\"removing-plot-elements\">Removing plot elements</h4>\n<p>The next thing I want to modify is the grid lines. I personally don’t like them so I’m going to remove them. This <em>could</em> be done with <code>element_line()</code> by matching the grid line colour to the background colour, but off the top of my head I don’t know what the background colour is, and there’s a much simpler solution: <code>element_blank()</code>. This removes aspects of our plot by generating an empty list entry for that plot component.</p>\n<pre>plot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank()\n )\n</pre><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes) but grid lines have been removed, so that the points on the scatter plot are on a plain, white background.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/grid.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes) but grid lines have been removed, so that the points on the scatter plot are on a plain, white background.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/grid.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/></noscript>\n<p>assigning <code>element_blank()</code> to <code>panel.grid()</code> removes all grid lines. If we only wanted to remove the minor ones, we would set <code>panel.grid.minor = element_blank()</code>. If we wanted to remove only the vertical lines (for whatever reason), we can set <code>panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()</code> and <code>panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()</code>. Removing only the horizontal ones is the same, but swap <code>x</code> for <code>y</code>. This shows that although <code>theme()</code> might have 99 arguments, there is structure to argument names which reduces how many you really need to remember.</p>\n<h4 id=\"modifying-text-features\">Modifying text features</h4>\n<p>Text features are the next thing I’m going to change. We’re going to do two things at once here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>change the font for <em>all</em> text features with the <code>text</code> argument</li>\n<li>change the positioning and size of the plot title with the <code>plot.title</code> argument</li>\n</ul>\n<p>we’ll adjust both of these via the <code>element_text()</code> function</p>\n<pre>plot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"), ## modify font\n plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18) ## modify positioning and size\n )\n</pre><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes, no grid lines) but all text now uses the lato font, and the main plot title is centered and larger.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/text.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes, no grid lines) but all text now uses the lato font, and the main plot title is centered and larger.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/text.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/></noscript>\n<p>the <code>family</code> argument lets us specify the font: we’re using the lato font here. I won’t delve too much into fonts, but <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/showtext/vignettes/introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">{showtext}</a> is a package that makes using a wide variety of fonts straightforward. I’d definitely recommend playing with fonts if you’re looking to develop a theme for a corporate identity, or simply add some personality to a plot.</p>\n<p>The <code>hjust</code> argument controls the <em>horizontal justification</em>, essentially, the positioning of the text. <code>hjust = 0</code> is left justification (the text is moved to the left), <code>hjust = 1</code> is right justification (text moved to the right), and numbers between 0 and 1 will position the text somewhere between the far right and far left. Setting <code>hjust = 0.5</code> centers the text for us. I’ve not used <code>vjust</code>, but this argument adjusts the vertical justification. Note that on the y axis, <code>hjust</code> moves the text along the axis, and <code>vjust</code> moves the text closer to/further away from the y axis. The <code>size</code> argument is just the font size in <code>pts</code>, something we will all be familiar with. The result is that the text, especially the title, shines through a little more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"borders-and-backgrounds\">Borders and backgrounds</h4>\n<p>Borders and backgrounds are next on our list of things to modify. We use <code>element_rect()</code> (rect as in rectangle) to change the styling of things such as the background around our legend or the entire plot background. By default, the legend background will be the same as the plot background, so it isn’t actually obvious that the legend even has a background! We’re going to modify the plot background here. The plot is currently sitting on a white background, and the web page you’re viewing also has a white background. This means that the plot melts into the webpage. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you might want to frame your plot a bit by putting in on a coloured background. Alternatively, you might have a corporate slide deck with a coloured background, and want the plot to melt into this background.</p>\n<pre>plot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"),\n plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18),\n plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#dffffc\", colour = \"#dffffc\")\n )\n</pre><p>The <code>fill</code> argument here changes the actual plot background. The <code>colour</code> argument (<code>color</code> will also work if you’re u-averse) controls the colour of a thin border all the way around the plot. The colour <code>#dffffc</code> is a very pale blue, which ensures that there is sufficient contract between the points and background of the plot. This is an important accessibility feature, so do think very carefully about how changing the background colour of your plot may impact the ability for other people to properly absorb the message you are trying to communicate. I’d generally avoid changing the background colour, but it’s useful here for demonstration purposes. To reiterate: if you <em>do</em> change the background colour, take care to ensure that accessibility is not compromised.</p>\n<img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes, no grid lines, modified text) but entire plot background has been changed to a pale blue colour.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/background.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes, no grid lines, modified text) but entire plot background has been changed to a pale blue colour.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/background.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/></noscript>\n<p>That brings to a close our introduction to each of the <code>element_*()</code> functions. I know it was a bit traumatic before, but if you type <code>?theme</code> into your R console, you’ll notice that the help page tells you which <code>element_*()</code> function you need to use for each <code>theme()</code> argument.</p>\n<h4 id=\"creating-space\">Creating space</h4>\n<p>The last function that we use to modify aspects of a theme is <code>margin()</code>. Margin is a little bit different to the <code>element_*()</code> functions, instead of controlling colours, fonts and line types, <code>margin()</code> lets us create or remove space around certain aspects of our theme by modify distances. If an argument needs to be modified with <code>margin()</code>, it’s likely that the argument name looks like <code>something.margin</code>. You may also notice that <code>element_text()</code> has a margin argument – use <code>margin()</code> here to create space around the text aspects of your plot.</p>\n<p>There are 5 arguments to <code>margin()</code>: <code>t</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>l</code> and <code>unit</code>. <code>t</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>l</code> are short for top, right, bottom and left – to remember the order, it’s just clockwise from the top. You should assign a number to these arguments, then <code>unit</code> is simply the units of these values. <code>unit</code> defaults to <code>pt</code>, which scales well with text, but you can choose something else if that makes more sense to you.</p>\n<p>Let’s now modify the space between (a) the plot title and the scatterplot itself and also (b) the legend and the x axis.</p>\n<pre>plot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"),\n plot.title = element_text(\n hjust = 0.5, size = 18, margin = margin(b = 30) # modify title-plot spacing\n ),\n plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#dffffc\", colour = \"#dffffc\"),\n legend.margin = margin(t = 15) # modify x axis-legend spacing\n )\n</pre><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes, no grid lines, modified text, pale blue background) but there is now more space between the plot title and main plot, and the legend and the main plot.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/margin.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/><noscript><img alt=\"The same scatter plot as above (theme minimal, legend at bottom, grey axes, no grid lines, modified text, pale blue background) but there is now more space between the plot title and main plot, and the legend and the main plot.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/intro-to-theme-ggplot2-r/graphics/margin.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"/></noscript>\n<p>Now this is our final plot! Each individual step made a minor adjustment to the plot, but added together, we have a plot with a much improved appearance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bringing-it-all-together\">Bringing it all together</h3>\n<p>An important programming concept is don’t repeat yourself (DRY). This applies to constructing graphics as well. We don’t want to copy and paste our theme for every plot we make. The great thing about {ggplot2} themes is that they can be effortlessly applied to basically any plot. All we have to do it turn out theme into a function, and then it can be used just like any of the “built in” {ggplot2} themes. For example:</p>\n<pre>my_theme = function(){\n theme_minimal() +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"),\n plot.title = element_text(\n hjust = 0.5, size = 18, margin = margin(b = 30)\n ),\n plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#dffffc\", colour = \"#dffffc\"),\n legend.margin = margin(t = 15)\n )\n}\n</pre><p>notice that the first line of the function is <code>theme_minimal()</code>, we used this theme as a starting point for our custom theme.</p>\n<p>Then we can apply this to any other plot as we would apply a standard {ggplot2} theme:</p>\n<pre>my_boxplot = penguins %&gt;%\n drop_na() %&gt;%\n ggplot(aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +\n geom_boxplot(fill = \"#ff9300\") +\n xlab(\"Species\") +\n ylab(\"Flipper length (mm)\") +\n ggtitle(\"Which type of penguin has the longest flippers?\")\n\nmy_boxplot + my_theme()\n</pre><img alt=\"A boxplot (vertical arrangement) with penguin flipper length (mm) on the y axis and species on x axis.

We can just add <code>my_theme()</code> to all of our plots to ensure consistent styling. If we wanted to make minor adjustments to the theme for a specific plot, we can just add on the <code>theme()</code> command again and make the required adjustments.\nIf you want to apply the style to all plots in a single script or report, <code>theme_set()</code> is a really handy way to do this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h3>\n<p>The <code>theme()</code> function has a lot of arguments, and it can feel overwhelming if you’re wanting to start modifying your own theme. We’ve managed to gain a little bit of experience with the tools that modify a {ggplot2} theme, and now you should have the confidence to modify other elements on your own, and try out the different arguments in <code>element_*()</code> functions.</p>\n<p>If you’re wanting to explore what makes a really good chart, I’d recommend the <a href=\"https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">RSS style guide</a> for practical, actionable advice on constructing publication-ready graphics with examples in both R and Python.

    "main_text": "Getting started with theme()\nPosted on\nNovember 23, 2023\nby\nThe Jumping Rivers Blog\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nThe Jumping Rivers Blog\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nThe\ntheme()\nfunction in {ggplot2} is awesome. Although it’s only one function, it gives you so much control over your final plot.\ntheme()\nallows us to generate a consistent, in-house style for our graphics, modify the text within our plots and more. Getting comfortable with\ntheme()\nwill really take your {ggplot2} skills up a notch.\nNormally, when people want help with an R function I tell them to use the built-in documentation about the function. This is normally done by typing\n?function_name\ninto the console. It’s usually pretty informative and often enough to help people understand a new function.\nSo let’s try this with\ntheme()\n…\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\n?theme\nYou probably feel a bit like this now:\nIf you’re coding along with me you’ll be able to see there’s loads of arguments to\ntheme()\n. If you’re patient and like counting, you’ll find that there are\nninety-nine\narguments to the\ntheme()\nfunction.\nDo you need to know all of these arguments?\nNo.\nDo I know all of these arguments?\nAlso no\n.\nWhat to we want to achieve?\nBy the end of this blog post, you are going to:\nbecome familiar with a handful of\ntheme()\narguments\nbe able to understand how to modify theme elements\nhave built the confidence to try modifying aspects of a theme on your own\nWhat I’m not aiming to do:\nconstruct a the world’s most elegant {ggplot2} theme\nshow you every single thing that can be modified via\ntheme()\nBasically, I want to give you the tools to make your plots look the way you want them to.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that this post is peppered with personal opinion; I want you to absorb how I’ve managed to implement my stylistic choices, not take these choices as the “truth”.\nWhether you want to start from scratch, or improve your skills,\nJumping Rivers has a training course for you\n.\nBuilding a basic plot\nIn order to modify a plot theme, we’re going to need a plot to start with. We’re going to work with a simple scatter plot derived from the Palmer Penguins data set. The data are freely available via the {palmerpenguins} package.\nlibrary(\"tidyr\")\nlibrary(\"RColorBrewer\") # pkg for nice colours\npenguins = palmerpenguins::penguins\npalette = brewer.pal(3, \"Set2\") # pick some nice colours\n\nbase_plot = penguins %>%\n drop_na() %>% # remove missing values\n ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, colour = species)) +\n geom_point() +\n scale_colour_manual(values = palette) +\n ggtitle(\"Do heavier penguins have longer bills?\") +\n labs(colour = \"Species\") +\n xlab(\"Body mass (g)\") +\n ylab(\"Bill length (mm)\")\n\nbase_plot\nWe’ve created a basic scatter plot here. It’s perhaps one you’ve seen before. Perfectly functional, but lacks personality.\nUsing built in {ggplot2} themes\nA good starting point for modifying your plot theme is actually to side-step\ntheme()\nand use one of the themes provided by {ggplot2}. The themes all have similar names:\ntheme_*()\n. I personally tend to start with\ntheme_minimal()\n, but feel free to try some others. For example,\ntheme_classic()\nor\ntheme_light()\n. The usage of these themes is super simple, just add it to your plot a bit like a\ngeom_*()\n:\nplot = base_plot +\n theme_minimal()\nWe’ve now got a plot which looks cleaner. There’s still some things that I don’t like. For example, I don’t like having my legend at the side of the plot and I don’t like the grid lines. We can modify these with\ntheme()\n.\nOur first theme() modification\nThe first thing I like to do is move the legend to the bottom of the plot. This is where we start to use the\ntheme()\nfunction to modify our plot appearance. This one isn’t too tricky, we just specify (as a string) where we want our legend to sit.\nplot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\"\n )\nAnd here’s the result:\nOkay, that wasn’t too bad. The other options here would be\n\"top\"\n,\n\"left\"\nor\n\"right\"\nto modify the position, or\n\"none\"\nto remove the legend entirely.\nI’d like to you meet my friends: the element_*() functions\nMost arguments of the\ntheme()\nfunction don’t take simple values like character or numeric values as arguments. A large number of the arguments take in a list of a specific class, where the list elements describe what the plot looks like. We can generate this list via an\nelement_*()\nfunction. The functions are\nelement_blank()\n,\nelement_rect()\n,\nelement_line()\n,\nelement_text()\n. Each of these functions has arguments which modify a given feature of our plot. I’ll run you through how each of the\nelement_*()\nfunctions might be used, but remember just like any other function\n?element_*()\nwill show you more\nModifying line elements\nNow our plot doesn’t have any lines on to indicate where the axes are. Suppose I want to make it clear where the axis lines are. Because these are, well,\nlines\n, I can use\nelement_line()\nto include them as so:\nplot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\")\n )\nobviously we all have different favourite colours, use whatever you like. Neutral colours (probably just shades of grey) are probably best for anything professional or for publication.\nSo here we’ve specified the colour of the line element which corresponds to\naxis.line\n. We can change other characteristics here like\nlinewidth\nor\nlinetype\n, but I’ll leave that for you to experiment with later.\nRemoving plot elements\nThe next thing I want to modify is the grid lines. I personally don’t like them so I’m going to remove them. This\ncould\nbe done with\nelement_line()\nby matching the grid line colour to the background colour, but off the top of my head I don’t know what the background colour is, and there’s a much simpler solution:\nelement_blank()\n. This removes aspects of our plot by generating an empty list entry for that plot component.\nplot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank()\n )\nassigning\nelement_blank()\nto\npanel.grid()\nremoves all grid lines. If we only wanted to remove the minor ones, we would set\npanel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n. If we wanted to remove only the vertical lines (for whatever reason), we can set\npanel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()\nand\npanel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n. Removing only the horizontal ones is the same, but swap\nx\nfor\ny\n. This shows that although\ntheme()\nmight have 99 arguments, there is structure to argument names which reduces how many you really need to remember.\nModifying text features\nText features are the next thing I’m going to change. We’re going to do two things at once here:\nchange the font for\nall\ntext features with the\ntext\nargument\nchange the positioning and size of the plot title with the\nplot.title\nargument\nwe’ll adjust both of these via the\nelement_text()\nfunction\nplot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"), ## modify font\n plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18) ## modify positioning and size\n )\nthe\nfamily\nargument lets us specify the font: we’re using the lato font here. I won’t delve too much into fonts, but\n{showtext}\nis a package that makes using a wide variety of fonts straightforward. I’d definitely recommend playing with fonts if you’re looking to develop a theme for a corporate identity, or simply add some personality to a plot.\nThe\nhjust\nargument controls the\nhorizontal justification\n, essentially, the positioning of the text.\nhjust = 0\nis left justification (the text is moved to the left),\nhjust = 1\nis right justification (text moved to the right), and numbers between 0 and 1 will position the text somewhere between the far right and far left. Setting\nhjust = 0.5\ncenters the text for us. I’ve not used\nvjust\n, but this argument adjusts the vertical justification. Note that on the y axis,\nhjust\nmoves the text along the axis, and\nvjust\nmoves the text closer to/further away from the y axis. The\nsize\nargument is just the font size in\npts\n, something we will all be familiar with. The result is that the text, especially the title, shines through a little more.\nBorders and backgrounds\nBorders and backgrounds are next on our list of things to modify. We use\nelement_rect()\n(rect as in rectangle) to change the styling of things such as the background around our legend or the entire plot background. By default, the legend background will be the same as the plot background, so it isn’t actually obvious that the legend even has a background! We’re going to modify the plot background here. The plot is currently sitting on a white background, and the web page you’re viewing also has a white background. This means that the plot melts into the webpage. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you might want to frame your plot a bit by putting in on a coloured background. Alternatively, you might have a corporate slide deck with a coloured background, and want the plot to melt into this background.\nplot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"),\n plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18),\n plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#dffffc\", colour = \"#dffffc\")\n )\nThe\nfill\nargument here changes the actual plot background. The\ncolour\nargument (\ncolor\nwill also work if you’re u-averse) controls the colour of a thin border all the way around the plot. The colour\n#dffffc\nis a very pale blue, which ensures that there is sufficient contract between the points and background of the plot. This is an important accessibility feature, so do think very carefully about how changing the background colour of your plot may impact the ability for other people to properly absorb the message you are trying to communicate. I’d generally avoid changing the background colour, but it’s useful here for demonstration purposes. To reiterate: if you\ndo\nchange the background colour, take care to ensure that accessibility is not compromised.\nThat brings to a close our introduction to each of the\nelement_*()\nfunctions. I know it was a bit traumatic before, but if you type\n?theme\ninto your R console, you’ll notice that the help page tells you which\nelement_*()\nfunction you need to use for each\ntheme()\nargument.\nCreating space\nThe last function that we use to modify aspects of a theme is\nmargin()\n. Margin is a little bit different to the\nelement_*()\nfunctions, instead of controlling colours, fonts and line types,\nmargin()\nlets us create or remove space around certain aspects of our theme by modify distances. If an argument needs to be modified with\nmargin()\n, it’s likely that the argument name looks like\nsomething.margin\n. You may also notice that\nelement_text()\nhas a margin argument – use\nmargin()\nhere to create space around the text aspects of your plot.\nThere are 5 arguments to\nmargin()\n:\nt\n,\nr\n,\nb\n,\nl\nand\nunit\n.\nt\n,\nr\n,\nb\nand\nl\nare short for top, right, bottom and left – to remember the order, it’s just clockwise from the top. You should assign a number to these arguments, then\nunit\nis simply the units of these values.\nunit\ndefaults to\npt\n, which scales well with text, but you can choose something else if that makes more sense to you.\nLet’s now modify the space between (a) the plot title and the scatterplot itself and also (b) the legend and the x axis.\nplot +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"),\n plot.title = element_text(\n hjust = 0.5, size = 18, margin = margin(b = 30) # modify title-plot spacing\n ),\n plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#dffffc\", colour = \"#dffffc\"),\n legend.margin = margin(t = 15) # modify x axis-legend spacing\n )\nNow this is our final plot! Each individual step made a minor adjustment to the plot, but added together, we have a plot with a much improved appearance.\nBringing it all together\nAn important programming concept is don’t repeat yourself (DRY). This applies to constructing graphics as well. We don’t want to copy and paste our theme for every plot we make. The great thing about {ggplot2} themes is that they can be effortlessly applied to basically any plot. All we have to do it turn out theme into a function, and then it can be used just like any of the “built in” {ggplot2} themes. For example:\nmy_theme = function(){\n theme_minimal() +\n theme(\n legend.position = \"bottom\",\n axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n panel.grid = element_blank(),\n text = element_text(family = \"lato\"),\n plot.title = element_text(\n hjust = 0.5, size = 18, margin = margin(b = 30)\n ),\n plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#dffffc\", colour = \"#dffffc\"),\n legend.margin = margin(t = 15)\n )\n}\nnotice that the first line of the function is\ntheme_minimal()\n, we used this theme as a starting point for our custom theme.\nThen we can apply this to any other plot as we would apply a standard {ggplot2} theme:\nmy_boxplot = penguins %>%\n drop_na() %>%\n ggplot(aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +\n geom_boxplot(fill = \"#ff9300\") +\n xlab(\"Species\") +\n ylab(\"Flipper length (mm)\") +\n ggtitle(\"Which type of penguin has the longest flippers?\")\n\nmy_boxplot + my_theme()\nThat was easy! We can just add\nmy_theme()\nto all of our plots to ensure consistent styling. If we wanted to make minor adjustments to the theme for a specific plot, we can just add on the\ntheme()\ncommand again and make the required adjustments.\nIf you want to apply the style to all plots in a single script or report,\ntheme_set()\nis a really handy way to do this.\nWhat next?\nThe\ntheme()\nfunction has a lot of arguments, and it can feel overwhelming if you’re wanting to start modifying your own theme. We’ve managed to gain a little bit of experience with the tools that modify a {ggplot2} theme, and now you should have the confidence to modify other elements on your own, and try out the different arguments in\nelement_*()\nfunctions.\nIf you’re wanting to explore what makes a really good chart, I’d recommend the\nRSS style guide\nfor practical, actionable advice on constructing publication-ready graphics with examples in both R and Python.
