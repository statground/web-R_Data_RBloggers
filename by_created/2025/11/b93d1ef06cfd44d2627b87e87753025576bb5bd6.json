      "meta_description": "You've built two regression models—one simple and one more complex model. The complex one seems to have a slightly better fit, but is that improvement statistically meaningful, or just noise from the observed data? How do you prove, with statistical certainty, that the extra complexity is actually worth it? You prove it using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). In essence, the LRT is a hypothesis test explicitly designed to compare the goodness of fit of two nested models. One model must be a simpler version (a subset) of the other. The test calculates a statistic based on the difference in the log-likelihood values between your two models. This test statistic follows a known chi-squared distribution. By comparing our result to this distribution, we get a p-value. If this p-value is below our chosen Statistical significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This provides strong evidence that the more complex model offers a significant improvement in fit. If the p-value is high, we conclude the extra complexity isn't justified.
