We’ve got a great mix of workshops and a full day of talks, with speakers\nbeing announced soon. You’ll find all the workshop details below,\nand you can sign up now on the <a href=\"https://shiny-in-production.jumpingrivers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">conference website</a>.\nWhether you’re just getting started with Shiny or have been using it for years, come join us for a great\nhands-on experience with Shiny and other web-based development tools.</p>\n<p>Day one of the conference (Wednesday 8th October), will consist of\nthe four parallel workshops running from 13:30 to 17:00, followed by a drinks reception in the\nevening, a great opportunity for networking and debriefing from the\nday’s learning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shiny-in-production.jumpingrivers.com/\" id=\"register-now\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><button class=\"buttony-link central-content\" type=\"button\">Register\nnow</button></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"workshop-1-end-to-end-testing-for-shiny-with-playwright-and-golem---colin-fayhttpscolinfayme\">Workshop 1: End-to-End testing for {shiny} with Playwright and {golem} – <a href=\"https://colinfay.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Colin Fay</a></h3>\n<p>A Shiny application that dazzles in development can still fall apart in\nproduction if user journeys break, data pipelines drift, or browsers\nbehave unexpectedly. Automated end-to-end (E2E) testing is the safety\nnet that keeps released apps robust, and Playwright is quickly becoming\nthe gold-standard tool for doing it across Chrome, Firefox and WebKit.\nIn this hands-on workshop we’ll walk through a workflow for writing,\nrunning and maintaining Playwright tests that keep your Shiny apps\nship-shape long after launch. Here’s what we’ll tackle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>why E2E testing matters even when you already have unit tests</li>\n<li>installing and configuring Playwright in a golem project using {pw}</li>\n<li>scripting core user flows—clicks, inputs…</li>\n<li>validating data and UI state with snapshots and assertions</li>\n<li>running tests headlessly in CI pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Posit Connect)</li>\n<li>handling Shiny specificity</li>\n<li>debugging failed tests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this workshop, bring a laptop and a Shiny app you care about.\nYou’ll leave with a working Playwright test harness you can drop\nstraight into your projects—plus the confidence to deploy on Friday without fear.</p>\n<p>By the end of the workshop, participants will…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understand the role of end-to-end testing in the Shiny deployment pipeline</li>\n<li>be able to install Playwright and scaffold tests from R</li>\n<li>write expressive Playwright scripts that capture user journeys in a Shiny app</li>\n<li>run tests in parallel across browsers locally and in continuous-integration systems</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"about-the-speaker\">About the speaker</h4>\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<img alt=\"Photo of Colin Fay\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-in-production-2025-workshop-announcement/images/colin-fay.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Photo of Colin Fay\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-in-production-2025-workshop-announcement/images/colin-fay.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript>\n<p>Colin Fay is a Lead Developer at <a href=\"https://thinkr.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkR</a>, a French agency specializing in all things R.\nBy day, he helps companies unlock R’s full potential by building tools, architecting infrastructure,\nand developing data and software engineering solutions.

It happens because a single R process handles all of the\nserver-side processing for multiple users—one long-running task can prevent any other\ntask from proceeding, hampering interactivity both between and within user-sessions.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Shiny’s support for asynchronous programming\ncan alleviate this problem. In the asynchronous approach, you start tasks\nrunning without having to wait for them to complete. But, this requires a\nchange in mindset for many programmers and there are a few concepts to understand\nbefore you can take advantage of this approach. So, what are you waiting for?\nSign up for this workshop!</p>\n<p>By the end of the workshop, participants will…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understand how within-session and between-session blocking can arise in a Shiny app</li>\n<li>understand the basics of asynchronous computation</li>\n<li>solve between-session blocking with future/promise</li>\n<li>solve blocking the modern way, with ExtendedTask</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"about-the-speaker-1\">About the speaker</h4>\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<img alt=\"Photo of Dr Russ Hyde\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-in-production-2025-workshop-announcement/images/russ@2x.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Photo of Dr Russ Hyde\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-in-production-2025-workshop-announcement/images/russ@2x.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript>\n<p>Russ has previously worked in molecular biology and bioinformatics.

The user can zoom to focus on\nareas of interest. In this workshop you will learn how to present geographic data\nin a shiny application.

Indeed, we find that clients\nprovide lots of feedback on the look and feel of an app, and that it is useful to prepare\na view of the overall design even before any interactive functionality is implemented,\nso that design feedback can be obtained as early as possible.</p>\n<p>Graphical tools like Figma allow the designer to build both coarse- and\nfine-grained illustrations of how an application or website will look, and simulate\nthe user workflow through the application. The designs can be shared with clients,\nand feedback gathered through comments pinned to the design.</p>\n<p>This workshop requires no prior experience in UI/UX design and will guide\nyou through your first steps in Figma, demonstrating how to quickly prepare design\nideas for Shiny applications. We’ll also get you started with creating some components—reusable\nmodules of your design that can transition into different states. You will need a Figma\naccount to participate; there is a free-tier that is sufficient for the workshop.</p>\n<p>By the end of the workshop, participants will…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create simple wireframe designs in Figma</li>\n<li>set font styles and colour palettes consistently across your design</li>\n<li>use the bootstrap UI kit in Figma</li>\n<li>create small components with a simple transition into an alternative state</li>\n<li>use CSS to replicate a simple Figma design in Shiny</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"about-the-speaker-3\">About the speaker</h4>\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<img alt=\"Photo of Dr keith Newman\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-in-production-2025-workshop-announcement/images/keith-newman@2x.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Photo of Dr keith Newman\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-in-production-2025-workshop-announcement/images/keith-newman@2x.jpg?w=578&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript>\n<p>Following a PhD in statistics at Newcastle University,\nKeith developed software to improve road safety modelling.\nHe enjoys creating Shiny apps and teaching the use of R.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h3>\n<p>Early bird tickets for the conference are still available <strong>at the time of writing</strong>, so don’t miss out!\nThe full line up of speakers will be\nannounced in the coming weeks.
