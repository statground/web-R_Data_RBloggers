I wanted to build upon that and use Lighthouse to test some Shiny apps.</p>\n<p>To get a feel for Shiny’s performance in a Lighthouse analysis, I needed a lot of shiny\napps that I could test and create a dataset from, so I used the entries to the\n<a href=\"https://posit.co/blog/time-to-shiny/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Shiny app contest</a>,\nwhich is a competition where people enter Shiny apps to be judged on technical merit\nand artistic achievement. I used the 2021 apps as there has unfortunately not been a\ncompetition since. A full list of the submissions can be found on the\n<a href=\"https://community.rstudio.com/tags/c/shiny/shiny-contest/30/shiny-contest-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Posit Community website</a>.</p>\n<p>To actually obtain data from these apps I used\n<a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Lighthouse</a> in the\nsame way I described for general web pages in the <a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">previous blog</a> in this series. This\ngenerated a Lighthouse report for each app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"google-lighthouse\">Google Lighthouse</h3>\n<p>To test a singular app from the contest it was exactly the same as testing a normal webpage, I simply ran:</p>\n<pre>lighthouse --output json --output-path data/output_file.json url\n</pre><p>Where <code>url</code> is the app I’m testing. You can also test in browser using devtools\n(as demonstrated in the last blog), but I was testing a lot of apps so I needed to do it programmatically.</p>\n<p>Before we get into the data it’s important to point out that Google Lighthouse scores do vary; you may run a report on an app that I’ve covered and get a different score. There are a number of reasons for this <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/#fluctuations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">covered here</a>, so the devs recommend running multiple tests. I’d also like to point out I have only run the report once for each app due to length of time it would take to run reports on all the apps a few times.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\nDo you require help building a Shiny app? Would you like someone to take over the maintenance burden?\nIf so, check out\nour\n<a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/consultancy/shiny-dash-flask-dashboard-consultancy/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=2023-shiny-contest\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Shiny and Dash</a>\nservices.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 id=\"app-data\">App data</h3>\n<p>The entries to the 2021 Shiny app contest were great! Loads of unique and interesting apps,\ngiven it was 2021 there were plenty of COVID- and election-related apps. I ran Lighthouse reports locally on\n268 of the Shiny app contest submissions (some of the links were broken), and have compiled a few\nplots to summarise the performance of the apps.</p>\n<p>Below is a histogram showing the distribution of overall performance scores for the\napps. The Lighthouse docs give the following advice for apps based on performance scores:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>90-100 is an app with good performance;</li>\n<li>50-89 is an app that needs some improvement;</li>\n<li>and 0-49 is an app with poor performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we can see many of the apps (79 / 268) have good performance, whereas the bulk of the apps are in need of some improvement (149 / 268) or have poor overall performance (40 / 268).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Distribution of overall scores for the apps, with the mean score of 73.2 marked.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse-part-2/images/score_hist.png?resize=450%2C528&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" height=\"528\" id=\"h-rh-i-0\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" width=\"450\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Distribution of overall scores for the apps, with the mean score of 73.2 marked.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" height=\"528\" id=\"h-rh-i-0\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse-part-2/images/score_hist.png?resize=450%2C528&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"450\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>We can dive deeper into the distribution of the raw values that are used in\ncalculating the overall performance score. The performance score is a weighted sum\nof some metrics formed from these raw (time) values – see the\n<a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/shiny-app-start-up-google-lighthouse/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">previous blog</a> for\nmore details on what each of these metrics means. The scores follow a similar\ntrend – most of the measurements fall on the faster side of the spectrum then\ndecrease as the time increases. I think this was to be expected based on the\ndistribution of the performance score seen earlier, as most of the apps scored\npretty well.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"App metric scores for six different metrics: Cumulative Layout Shift, First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, Speed Index, Time to Interactive, Total Blocking Time.

The Shiny app contest has two sections one for &lt; 1\nyear’s experience and another for &gt; 1 years experience, so people new to Shiny are\nlikely to have been experimenting with what’s possible in an app and not focusing on\nperformance.</p>\n<p>That being said I’d like to reiterate what Colin Fay said in his talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_k-iPwcleU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">“Destroy All Widgets”</a>\nabout being sensible with widget use within apps, and understanding that they can hinder performance and increase wait times when they are\nnot always necessary. For instance do you really need a {plotly} plot or would a ggplot suffice?

      "main_text": "Analysing Shiny App start-up Times with Google Lighthouse\nPosted on\nDecember 7, 2023\nby\nThe Jumping Rivers Blog\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nThe Jumping Rivers Blog\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nThis is part one of a three part series on Lighthouse for Shiny Apps.\nPart 1:\nUsing Google Lighthouse for Web Pages\nPart 2: Analysing Shiny App start-up Times with Google Lighthouse (This post)\nPart 3: Effect of Shiny Widgets with Google Lighthouse (Coming soon)\nIntro\nIn the last blog I spoke about using\nGoogle Lighthouse\nto test the speed of web pages. I wanted to build upon that and use Lighthouse to test some Shiny apps.\nTo get a feel for Shiny’s performance in a Lighthouse analysis, I needed a lot of shiny\napps that I could test and create a dataset from, so I used the entries to the\n2021 Shiny app contest\n,\nwhich is a competition where people enter Shiny apps to be judged on technical merit\nand artistic achievement. I used the 2021 apps as there has unfortunately not been a\ncompetition since. A full list of the submissions can be found on the\nPosit Community website\n.\nTo actually obtain data from these apps I used\nGoogle Lighthouse\nin the\nsame way I described for general web pages in the\nprevious blog\nin this series. This\ngenerated a Lighthouse report for each app.\nGoogle Lighthouse\nTo test a singular app from the contest it was exactly the same as testing a normal webpage, I simply ran:\nlighthouse --output json --output-path data/output_file.json url\nWhere\nurl\nis the app I’m testing. You can also test in browser using devtools\n(as demonstrated in the last blog), but I was testing a lot of apps so I needed to do it programmatically.\nBefore we get into the data it’s important to point out that Google Lighthouse scores do vary; you may run a report on an app that I’ve covered and get a different score. There are a number of reasons for this\ncovered here\n, so the devs recommend running multiple tests. I’d also like to point out I have only run the report once for each app due to length of time it would take to run reports on all the apps a few times.\nDo you require help building a Shiny app? Would you like someone to take over the maintenance burden?\nIf so, check out\nour\nShiny and Dash\nservices.\nApp data\nThe entries to the 2021 Shiny app contest were great! Loads of unique and interesting apps,\ngiven it was 2021 there were plenty of COVID- and election-related apps. I ran Lighthouse reports locally on\n268 of the Shiny app contest submissions (some of the links were broken), and have compiled a few\nplots to summarise the performance of the apps.\nBelow is a histogram showing the distribution of overall performance scores for the\napps. The Lighthouse docs give the following advice for apps based on performance scores:\n90-100 is an app with good performance;\n50-89 is an app that needs some improvement;\nand 0-49 is an app with poor performance.\nAs we can see many of the apps (79 / 268) have good performance, whereas the bulk of the apps are in need of some improvement (149 / 268) or have poor overall performance (40 / 268).\nWe can dive deeper into the distribution of the raw values that are used in\ncalculating the overall performance score. The performance score is a weighted sum\nof some metrics formed from these raw (time) values – see the\nprevious blog\nfor\nmore details on what each of these metrics means. The scores follow a similar\ntrend – most of the measurements fall on the faster side of the spectrum then\ndecrease as the time increases. I think this was to be expected based on the\ndistribution of the performance score seen earlier, as most of the apps scored\npretty well.\nThe Apps\nI don’t highlight any of the apps on the lower end of the performance spectrum here, as\nit would be unfair on the creators. The Shiny app contest has two sections one for < 1\nyear’s experience and another for > 1 years experience, so people new to Shiny are\nlikely to have been experimenting with what’s possible in an app and not focusing on\nperformance.\nThat being said I’d like to reiterate what Colin Fay said in his talk\n“Destroy All Widgets”\nabout being sensible with widget use within apps, and understanding that they can hinder performance and increase wait times when they are\nnot always necessary. For instance do you really need a {plotly} plot or would a ggplot suffice? The same could be said about interactive data tables.\nI will highlight a couple of high scoring apps:\nThis app\nby Rabii Bouhestine is a really cool Geoguessr-esque game where you are trying to pinpoint the location of world wonders. This app received the overall score from Lighthouse of 95!\nAnother high scoring app is\n“Mix Things Up” by Sam Parmar\na previous competition winner who was a judge on the 2021 contest. This app is a simple yet efficient\nway to generate random work outs.\nThe last one I’m going to highlight is\nthis app\nby\nEdgar Cáceres, which is an app for visualising air quality data from the station in La\nOroya, Junin, Peru. This app is particularly impressive in it’s scores as it actually\nhas two interactive {leaflet} plots.\nGoogle Lighthouse is a good starting point for testing the start-up times of your apps, however it is worth noting that the score can be misleading.\nAn app may score very highly but not actually load fast for the user.

You can do this by adding\n--view\nafter the\nurl\nargument when running a test in the terminal. I will be using the next\nblog in this series to investigate this further.\nSo if you are developing a desktop Shiny app and want see see how it does you can use Lighthouse and this blog for a benchmark, although with a pinch of salt as there are many different kinds of apps that we tested – games and data visualations etc. Roughly, however, if your app scores better than 73 then that’s a good start. If you can’t bring your app load time down for whatever reason, maybe due data processing for example, then something you can do is use a loading screen to let your app-users know that something is happening. This is covered excellently at the start of this\nblog on Shiny extensions\n.\nIn the final blog in this series, we will be investigating the impact various widgets have on Shiny app Lighthouse scores.\nFor updates and revisions to this article, see the\noriginal post\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nThe Jumping Rivers Blog\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
