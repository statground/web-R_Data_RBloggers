First, some background.</p>\n<p>The empirical predictions in the paper are intended to provide insight into who is likely to win the ongoing Ukraine/Russia war.  Fighting requires soldiers and these are killed/wounded over time.  The country that does not have enough soldiers to at least keep the opposition at bay, looses.</p>\n<p>Turchin has proposed what he calls the Attrition War model, based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lanchester’s laws</a> (various <a href=\"http://www.ismor.com/ismor_archives/34ismor_archive/presentations/18_tuesday/34ismor_syms.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">attempts to validate Lanchester’s models</a>, lots of <a href=\"https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA090842\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">maths to shake a stick at</a>), and the paper solves this model’s set of eight <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">differential equations</a> (each country has the same set of four equations; the connection between the two sets is that one country’s casualty rate and Army size is influenced by the opposing country’s stock of war matériel).  The four quantities modelled are casualties, army size, stock of warfare matériel, and production capacity.</p>\n<p>Getting predictions out of differential equations requires being able to find a solution to the equations and feeding in numeric values for the various parameters.</p>\n<p>Solving the equations is a maths problem, i.e., no knowledge of military matters required.  Selecting the equations to solve and the numeric values to feed into the solution is what requires military knowledge.  I don’t know anything about military matters; the following analysis is purely related to writing code to solve a set of differential equations, using the equations plus numeric values in Turchin’s November 2023 paper.</p>\n<p>For obvious reasons, countries involved in the war do not publish information on the quantities modelled by these equations (which are also likely to be time-dependent).  Turchin addresses the changeable nature of the numeric values by introducing various random components into his Attrition model.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of solving the eight equations and presenting the results, the following are the two mistakes that jumped out at me (both involving the implementation of the random component):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a model contains a random component, there will be a huge/infinite number of possible solutions.  The takeaway plots in the paper show a single solution (for each of the four variables/two countries), with the width of the plotted lines and their fluctuating appearance suggesting that they contain multiple solutions.  The plot below left shows the solution for artillery shell production over time, as it appears in the paper, while the plot below right shows 100 solutions (each line is a different solution; <a href=\"https://shape-of-code.com/code-data/ukr-rus_war.R\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">code</a>):\n<p><img alt=\"Estimated growth in Ukraine/Russian war materiel produced over 5-years.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shape-of-code.com/images/uk-ru_shell-prod.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Estimated growth in Ukraine/Russian war materiel produced over 5-years.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shape-of-code.com/images/uk-ru_shell-prod.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>The wedge of lines shows the range of possible solutions (each line drawn overwrites anything previously drawn, and plotting with transparent colors would show the density of solution at a given point; I decided to keep the code simple).\n</p></li>\n<li>All the random components are assumed to have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gaussian distribution</a>.  When distribution information is not available, this is usually a safe choice.  However, two of the random components must always have non-negative values (i.e., casualties and matériel used can never be negative).  The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Poisson distribution</a> is the obvious candidate, and a simple search turned up an empirical paper agreeing with this choice (at least for casualties).\n<p>The plot below left shows one solution for the number of casualties over time, using the original code, while the plot below right shows 100 solutions using a Poisson distribution for the random component (<a href=\"https://shape-of-code.com/code-data/ukr-rus_war.R\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">code</a>):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Estimated growth in Ukraine/Russian casualties over 5-years.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shape-of-code.com/images/uk-ru_casualties.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"Estimated growth in Ukraine/Russian casualties over 5-years.\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/shape-of-code.com/images/uk-ru_casualties.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>With a Poisson random component, the solutions don’t meander as much, and the variance is smaller than when a Gaussian is used.  Technically, it is a more accurate model (if more variance is to be expected a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Negative Binomial distribution</a> could be used; see commented out <a href=\"https://shape-of-code.com/code-data/ukr-rus_war.R\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">code</a>)</p>\n<p>The latest (November) <a href=\"https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/uk-estimates-over-300000-russian-military-casualties/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">UK government estimate of Russian casualties</a> is 300K, roughly three times larger than predicted by Turchin’s model.

The\ncode for Imperial’s COVID model\nwas ten times larger.\nTwo mistakes in the code/paper jumped out at me, leading to this post.  First, some background.\nThe empirical predictions in the paper are intended to provide insight into who is likely to win the ongoing Ukraine/Russia war.  Fighting requires soldiers and these are killed/wounded over time.  The country that does not have enough soldiers to at least keep the opposition at bay, looses.\nTurchin has proposed what he calls the Attrition War model, based on\nLanchester’s laws\n(various\nattempts to validate Lanchester’s models\n, lots of\nmaths to shake a stick at\n), and the paper solves this model’s set of eight\ndifferential equations\n(each country has the same set of four equations; the connection between the two sets is that one country’s casualty rate and Army size is influenced by the opposing country’s stock of war matériel).  The four quantities modelled are casualties, army size, stock of warfare matériel, and production capacity.\nGetting predictions out of differential equations requires being able to find a solution to the equations and feeding in numeric values for the various parameters.\nSolving the equations is a maths problem, i.e., no knowledge of military matters required.  Selecting the equations to solve and the numeric values to feed into the solution is what requires military knowledge.  I don’t know anything about military matters; the following analysis is purely related to writing code to solve a set of differential equations, using the equations plus numeric values in Turchin’s November 2023 paper.\nFor obvious reasons, countries involved in the war do not publish information on the quantities modelled by these equations (which are also likely to be time-dependent).  Turchin addresses the changeable nature of the numeric values by introducing various random components into his Attrition model.\nFrom the perspective of solving the eight equations and presenting the results, the following are the two mistakes that jumped out at me (both involving the implementation of the random component):\nWhen a model contains a random component, there will be a huge/infinite number of possible solutions.  The takeaway plots in the paper show a single solution (for each of the four variables/two countries), with the width of the plotted lines and their fluctuating appearance suggesting that they contain multiple solutions.  The plot below left shows the solution for artillery shell production over time, as it appears in the paper, while the plot below right shows 100 solutions (each line is a different solution;\ncode\n):\nThe wedge of lines shows the range of possible solutions (each line drawn overwrites anything previously drawn, and plotting with transparent colors would show the density of solution at a given point; I decided to keep the code simple).\nAll the random components are assumed to have a\nGaussian distribution\n.  When distribution information is not available, this is usually a safe choice.  However, two of the random components must always have non-negative values (i.e., casualties and matériel used can never be negative).  The\nPoisson distribution\nis the obvious candidate, and a simple search turned up an empirical paper agreeing with this choice (at least for casualties).\nThe plot below left shows one solution for the number of casualties over time, using the original code, while the plot below right shows 100 solutions using a Poisson distribution for the random component (\ncode\n):\nWith a Poisson random component, the solutions don’t meander as much, and the variance is smaller than when a Gaussian is used.  Technically, it is a more accurate model (if more variance is to be expected a\nNegative Binomial distribution\ncould be used; see commented out\ncode\n)\nThe latest (November)\nUK government estimate of Russian casualties\nis 300K, roughly three times larger than predicted by Turchin’s model.  Changing the value for the ‘conversion rate of expended matériel to casualties’ from\nto\nbrings the casualty prediction inline with current estimates (we have been hearing a lot about the accuracy of the Ukrainian targetting; see code for details).\nI have also reworked the code to add some structure, e.g., separating out solving the equations and setting the initial conditions.\nTurchin used the traditional approach to solving differential equations, the one we are taught at school.  Before seeing the code, I was half expecting to see a\nSystem dynamics\napproach.  The advantage of a systems dynamic approach is flexibility (i.e., easier to add more components) and visualization (i.e., a chart showing what feeds into/out of what);\nan example\n.  There is an R-based book:\nSystem Dynamics Modelling with R\n.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nR – The Shape of Code\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
