All time2023 vs 2024 Pink Floyd emerges as the dominant artist with an impressive 2,400+ plays, showcasing my strong preference for their music Farida Khanum, with over 700 plays, stands as the second most-played artist, though significantly behind Pink Floyd Year-over-year analysis shows interesting shifts in artist preferences: Pink Floyd maintained top position in both 2023 and 2024 Only three artists (Pink Floyd, Kishore Kumar, and Anjan Dutta& Somlata Acharyya Chowdhury) remained in the top 10 across both years This indicates significant variation in listening patterns between years Pink Floyd is an iconic British rock band that revolutionized progressive rock through their philosophical lyrics, intricate compositions, and groundbreaking psychedelic soundscapes. Their masterpieces like “The Dark Side of the Moon” and “The Wall” are known for their conceptual depth, innovative studio techniques, and haunting explorations of themes like alienation, mental health, and societal pressure, making them one of the most influential and commercially successful bands in music history.

With over 45 million copies sold, it remains one of music’s most influential works, known for its immersive sonic experience and profound social commentary.

The song warns about the dangers of complacency and letting life slip away, highlighted by David Gilmour’s iconic guitar solos and Roger Waters’ introspective lyrics about how people suddenly realize they’re “shorter of breath and one day closer to death.” [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(Pink_Floyd_song) All Time2023 vs 2024 Back to top",
