I’m very fluent in SQL so the best analogy for me was the GROUP BY statement in SQL. PLYR adds very little new functionality to R. What it does do is take the process of SAC and make it cleaner, more tidy and easier. I think I’m not the only one who wants a clean and tidy SAC. Here’s a quick example of making some summary stats using PLYR:</p>\n<pre># install.packages(\"plyr\") #run this if you don't have the package already\n library(plyr)\n\n#make some example data\ndd&lt;-data.frame(matrix(rnorm(216),72,3),c(rep(\"A\",24),rep(\"B\",24),rep(\"C\",24)),c(rep(\"J\",36),rep(\"K\",36)))\ncolnames(dd) &lt;- c(\"v1\", \"v2\", \"v3\", \"dim1\", \"dim2\")\n\n#ddply is the plyr function\nddply(dd, c(\"dim1\",\"dim2\"), function(df)mean(df$v1))</pre>\n<p>result:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>    dim1 dim2          V1\n    1    A    J  0.02554362\n    2    B    J -0.15839675\n    3    B    K -0.06077399\n    4    C    K -0.02326776</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PLYR functions have a neat naming convention. The first two letters of the function tells the input and output data types, respectively. The one I use the most is ddply which takes a data frame in and spits out a data frame.  Let me see if I can explain what ddply is doing. The first argument, dd, is the input data frame. The next argument is the “group by” variables. Since I want to group by two variables I send them as a vector (that’s what the c() bit does). What threw me for a loop initially was the third argument, the function. What I found myself trying (unsuccessfully) was just using mean(v1) as the third argument. If I did that, R would spit at me and bring the marital status of my parents into question. I discovered that the problem was the ddply function was splitting the data by my ‘group by’ variables and then it wanted to pass each of the resulting data frames to a function. So what does it mean to pass a data frame to mean(v1)? Yeah, it means Jack Crap, that’s what it means. So in one of the PLYR examples I saw they were using these inline functions. The idea behind function(df)mean(df$v1) is to create a function to which we can pass a data frame and get out a meaningful result. The subset (or split) of the data gets passed to the function and that subset is then known as df. mean(df$v1) calculates the mean of v1 and returns an answer. ddply holds on to the answers of each split and then reassembles them all in the end. Slick, ey?</p>\n<p>As with most things in R the idea can be extended to a vector of functions in order to perform many operations on each split:</p>\n<pre>ddply(dd, c(\"dim1\",\"dim2\"), function(df)c(mean(df$v1),mean(df$v2),mean(df$v3),sd(df$v1),sd(df$v2),sd(df$v3)))</pre>\n<p>The result looks like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>dim1 dim2          V1        V2         V3        V4        V5       V6\n1    A    J  0.02554362 0.3400250  0.1206980 0.9326424 1.0044120 1.100762\n2    B    J -0.15839675 0.3662559 -0.1784193 0.7447807 0.8752162 1.105258\n3    B    K -0.06077399 0.5184403 -0.2076024 1.0385107 1.0609706 1.153153\n4    C    K -0.02326776 0.2639328  0.1352895 0.7940938 0.9025207 1.072460</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pretty nifty.</p>\n<p>The author of PLYR is Hadley Wickham who is also the man behind <a data-cf-modified-b3c07027f32d1911a908915c-=\"\" href=\"http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/\" onclick=\"if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/had.co.nz/ggplot2/?referer=');\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GGPLOT2</a>.

Since I want to group by two variables I send them as a vector (that’s what the c() bit does). What threw me for a loop initially was the third argument, the function. What I found myself trying (unsuccessfully) was just using mean(v1) as the third argument. If I did that, R would spit at me and bring the marital status of my parents into question. I discovered that the problem was the ddply function was splitting the data by my ‘group by’ variables and then it wanted to pass each of the resulting data frames to a function. So what does it mean to pass a data frame to mean(v1)? Yeah, it means Jack Crap, that’s what it means. So in one of the PLYR examples I saw they were using these inline functions. The idea behind function(df)mean(df$v1) is to create a function to which we can pass a data frame and get out a meaningful result. The subset (or split) of the data gets passed to the function and that subset is then known as df. mean(df$v1) calculates the mean of v1 and returns an answer. ddply holds on to the answers of each split and then reassembles them all in the end. Slick, ey?\nAs with most things in R the idea can be extended to a vector of functions in order to perform many operations on each split:\nddply(dd, c(\"dim1\",\"dim2\"), function(df)c(mean(df$v1),mean(df$v2),mean(df$v3),sd(df$v1),sd(df$v2),sd(df$v3)))\nThe result looks like this:\ndim1 dim2          V1        V2         V3        V4        V5       V6\n1    A    J  0.02554362 0.3400250  0.1206980 0.9326424 1.0044120 1.100762\n2    B    J -0.15839675 0.3662559 -0.1784193 0.7447807 0.8752162 1.105258\n3    B    K -0.06077399 0.5184403 -0.2076024 1.0385107 1.0609706 1.153153\n4    C    K -0.02326776 0.2639328  0.1352895 0.7940938 0.9025207 1.072460\nPretty nifty.\nThe author of PLYR is Hadley Wickham who is also the man behind\nGGPLOT2\n. If you like PLYR or GGPLOT2 then you should immediately\nbuy Hadley’s GGPLOT2 book on Amazon\n. But be sure and use the link on this site or the link on\nHadley’s site\nso he can get Amazon associate payment. The authors I have talked to told me they get more from the Associate program than they get from publishing royalties.\nMy father is a retired pilot turned crop farmer. He ALWAYS carries a pair of pliers in a nylon pouch on his belt. I can see that Hadley’s PLRY package is going to become my proverbial ‘belt pliers.’\nOf course if I wrote an R package I’d have to name it\nSuper RamBar\n, cause that’s just how I roll.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nCerebral Mastication » R\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nplyr\nR",
