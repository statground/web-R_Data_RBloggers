(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nPalaeoverse\n, a grassroots organization that develops R packages for paleontology, has been\nawarded a Large Grant\nfrom the\nSoftware Sustainability Institute\n, via the\nResearch Software Maintenance Fund\n, for the project ‘Converting Users to Contributors: Enabling Sustainable Maintenance and Development of Palaeoverse’.\nThis funding will support efforts to improve the sustainability and maintainability of several key R packages used in paleontological research.\nWelcome to Palaeoverse\nPalaeoverse\nis an initiative aiming to unite the paleontological community through shared resources, agreed standards, and a collective commitment to improving reproducibility in paleontological research.\nThe project began in 2022 when a group of early-career researchers, including myself, recognized a common challenge: many of us were independently developing similar programmatic workflows for cleaning and preparing paleontological data due to a lack of standardized tools and protocols, leading to duplicated work that was difficult to reproduce.\nIn response, we came together to develop the\npalaeoverse R package\n—a toolkit designed to streamline data preparation and exploration in paleontological research.\nSince then, Palaeoverse has evolved into a formally organized initiative with a growing scope.\nWe maintain multiple\nR packages\n, curate\nresources\n, host\nlectures\n, and run\ntraining workshops\n.\nThese resources have been developed entirely through the\ncurrent team\n’s voluntary efforts.\nThe Palaeoverse toolkit\nThe Palaeoverse toolkit currently includes several R packages that address various aspects of paleontological data pipelines:\nThe\npalaeoverse\npackage\n1\nprovides functionality to support data preparation and exploration for paleobiological analyses, improving code reproducibility and accessibility.\nThe aim of palaeoverse is to generate a community-driven software package of generic functions for the paleobiological community.\nThe package does not provide implementations of statistical analyses, rather it provides auxiliary functions to help streamline analyses and improve code readability and reproducibility.\nThe\nrphylopic\npackage\n2\nallows users to add silhouettes of organisms from the\nPhyloPic database\nto plots generated in base R and ggplot2.\nrphylopic was originally developed and maintained by\nScott Chamberlain\nfor rOpenSci.\nIn 2023 the Palaeoverse team took on maintenance of rphylopic, refactored the entire package, and released v1.0.0.\nThe\nrmacrostrat\npackage\n3\nprovides streamlined and improved accessibility to the geological database\nMacrostrat\n.\nThe package provides functionality for querying the database via the dedicated API and retrieving various geological data (such as lithostratigraphic units) and definitions/metadata associated with those data and Macrostrat more broadly.\nThe\nsepkoski\npackage\n4\nprovides access to Sepkoski’s fossil marine animal genera compendium\n5\n6\n.\nThe aim of the package is to offer a light and easily-accessible solution to working with Sepkoski’s compendium to support teaching exercises.\nSepkoski’s evolutionary fauna, using the Sepkoski fossil marine animal genera compendium, as plotted by the\nsepkoski_curve_base()\nfunction in the sepkoski R package. Number of genera are counted per international geological stage bin. The timescale on the x-axis comes from the\naxis_geo()\nfunction in the palaeoverse R package.\nFunding the next generation of contributors\nComputational methods play an increasingly central role in paleontology, creating a pressing need for reliable, community-endorsed software that supports reproducible research.\nPalaeoverse was established to address this demand, but its continued success now depends on broader community engagement to ensure its longevity and that its development reflects the diverse needs of the field, rather than those of its core contributors.\nAs the project expands, reducing maintenance overhead and strengthening long-term sustainability remain critical challenges for safeguarding its future.\nOur vision, therefore, is to evolve Palaeoverse into a community-driven project, where users actively contribute to the development, maintenance, and review of Palaeoverse software and resources.\nTo achieve our vision, we have identified two strategic priorities for the organization:\nFoster a contributor-friendly environment\n. This involves auditing and updating our software packages to improve internal structure, code readability, and maintainability.\nWe also want to develop comprehensive contributor guidelines and documentation to establish transparent and accessible standards.\nGrow community engagement and build a contributor network\n. We want to supplement our existing program of Palaeoverse workshops with bespoke training and community-building initiatives focused on software development and maintenance.\nGiven the low prevalence of these skills in paleontology, these events will be critical for equipping researchers with the knowledge and confidence needed to contribute to open-source scientific software, including Palaeoverse.\nThrough these efforts we will set clear expectations for contributions, streamline contributor submissions, and cultivate a contributor network.\nOur hope is that this will spur a new community-sustaining growth phase for Palaeoverse.\nUnfortunately, these lofty goals require a lot of time and money, and funding for maintenance of preexisting software is scarce (large research grants are usually looking for novel software) and all of the core contributors are busy with many other responsibilities…\nResearch Software Maintenance Fund\nLast April, the\nSoftware Sustainability Institute\nannounced a call for proposals for the first round of the\nResearch Software Maintenance Fund\n.\nThis fund aims to support the maintenance and sustainability of research software that is already in use by the community (that’s us!).\nThe Palaeoverse team put together a proposal for a Large Grant to cover these two strategic priorities.\nThen, in December, we found out that our proposal, ‘Converting Users to Contributors: Enabling Sustainable Maintenance and Development of Palaeoverse’, was chosen as one of four Large Awards\n7\nto be funded!\nThe funding, totaling ~£480,000 (~650,000 USD) over two years, will go towards:\nA dedicated, full-time Research Software Engineer who will audit and refactor the entire Palaeoverse toolkit, with a focus on improving standardization, accessibility, and reducing future maintenance needs.\nA dedicated, full-time Community Engagement Coordinator who will develop and run bespoke community training events on research software development (like\nThe Carpentries\n), hackathons, and a dedicated mentorship program (modeled after the\nrOpenSci Champions Program\n) to train the next generation of Palaeoverse contributors.\nFunds for travel and subsistence for the community training events, hackathons, and mentorship program.\nGetting involved in Palaeoverse\nWe are extremely excited for the future of Palaeoverse, and we invite you to join us for this next chapter, whether or not you are a paleontologist!\nThere are several ways to get involved:\nYou can contribute to the functionality of the Palaeoverse R toolkit.\nOur\ncontributing guide\nis a great place to start.\nYou can also check out our\nGitHub repositories\nto find issues that speak to you. For example, we have a lot of\nissues\nfor the palaeoverse package that would be great for new contributors.\nBecome a\nPalaeoverse Reviewer\nto help review code, documentation, and resources.\nWe particularly value community input to ensure that the toolkit has a smooth user experience.\nContribute to Palaeoverse databases like the\nDirectory\nand\nGrant Track\n, which aim to centralize useful information for the community.\nBe active in community spaces such as the\nPalaeoverse Google Group\n, where you can share ideas and resources, advertise opportunities, and network with colleagues.\nHelp us build a stronger community in computation paleontology!\nThe Google Group has been fairly quiet lately, but we’re hoping to breath new life into it as part of our new community initiatives!\nFollow us on\nsocial media\nand enjoy the ride!\nAltogether, we hope that, by devoting these resources to Palaeoverse over the next two years, we will build a strong community of users and contributors that will sustain the Palaeoverse R packages and broader organization for many years to come.\nJones, L.A., Gearty, W., Allen, B.J., Eichenseer, K., Dean, C.D., Galván S., Kouvari, M., Godoy, P.L., Nicholl, C., Dillon, E.M., Flannery-Sutherland, J.T., Chiarenza, A.A.

href=\"https://palaeoverse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Palaeoverse</a> is an initiative aiming to unite the paleontological community through shared resources, agreed standards, and a collective commitment to improving reproducibility in paleontological research.\nThe project began in 2022 when a group of early-career researchers, including myself, recognized a common challenge: many of us were independently developing similar programmatic workflows for cleaning and preparing paleontological data due to a lack of standardized tools and protocols, leading to duplicated work that was difficult to reproduce.\nIn response, we came together to develop the <a href=\"https://palaeoverse.palaeoverse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">palaeoverse R package</a>—a toolkit designed to streamline data preparation and exploration in paleontological research.\nSince then, Palaeoverse has evolved into a formally organized initiative with a growing scope.\nWe maintain multiple <a href=\"https://github.com/palaeoverse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">R packages</a>, curate <a href=\"https://palaeoverse.org/external\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">resources</a>, host <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ThePalaeoverse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lectures</a>, and run <a href=\"https://workshop.palaeoverse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">training workshops</a>.\nThese resources have been developed entirely through the <a href=\"https://palaeoverse.org/#about-us\" rel=\"nofollow\"
