The seven pieces of the puzzle are:\nVisual summaries of population size and growth\nNet migration\nWorld cities with the most Pacific Islanders\nPacific diaspora (this post, today)\nPopulation pyramids (to come)\nRemittances (to come)\nTying it all together (to come)\nToday’s post is all about creating this one eye-catching chart, comparing the number of people in a country with its diaspora—people who ethnically or otherwise identify with the country but are living overseas:\nAs the chart notes, the diaspora numbers are an underestimate because I’ve only drawn on the New Zealand, Australian and USA censuses, and only partly for that. For example, I decided the number of Papua New Guineans living in New Zealand and USA wasn’t material and they haven’t been included. I’m confident this doesn’t change the look of the chart, but obviously if I were trying to create the best possible comprehensive estimates I should include these.\nIt’s a pretty dramatic story. We can see seven countries with more people living overseas than in the country itself: Niue, Pitcairn Islands, Cook Islands, Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga and Marshall Islands. Apart from Marshall Islands, these are all Polynesian. In fact, Tuvalu is the only Polynesian country in this collection that has more people living in-country than overseas (for now—this is likely to change now that Australia has agreed with Tuvalu for a regular annual intake of people via lottery).\nNote that the three French territories (New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, and French Polynesia), and three American territories (American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands and Guam) have been excluded from the plot.\nFor the four small countries along the bottom row of the chart, the difference is particularly important—a big majority of their people are living overseas. From my last post we know that a lot of these are in Auckland. Pitcairn is the only one of these four that has more of its diaspora in Australia than New Zealand (there are Pitcairn-identifying people in the UK too, but not enough to make me systematically add in the UK to my data in what was essentially a pragmatic and visual exercise—see comments above).\n96% of Niueans, 90% of Cook Islanders and 59% of Marshall Islanders live overseas.\nAnd for the four countries at the top of the chart—somewhat larger and distinctly poorer than many of the others, and three of them Melanesian—we see no significant diaspora, relative to the home population.\nHere’s the code that creates this bar chart. Note that the data here are typed in by hand (!!) from various sources—not something I’d normally do, and would never recommend except for these really “small data” situations. I’ve checked it as thoroughly as I reasonably can, and the version I used in my talk that I’m adapting here was also peer reviewed by a work colleague.\n# This script draws some charts of the diaspora of Pacific island countries and territories.\n# It's pretty rough and certainly incomplete. The approach was to use the census figures\n# for resident population of Pacific islander ancestry currently living in USA, Australia\n# and New Zealand; and compare that to populations resideing in the countries themselves.\n#\n# All sorts of known limitations which we are prepared to live with for these crude comparisons:\n# - different reference years (2025 for populations, and census years are 2018, 2020 and 2021)\n# - populations residing in the Pacific islands themselves are all ethnicities (e.g. will include\n#   Australian-descent people rsideing in those countries), haven't bothered to limit to just \"true\" Tongans, Samoans, etc\n# - not comprehensive e.g. I know there are some Pitcairn-descended people in UK but haven't included them.

It’s difficult to interpret, and while it has a bit of extra information (which country the diaspora is in) this doesn’t outweigh the interpretation problems. it probably shouldn’t have a log scale as we really want to add up the numbers; but using a non-transformed scale makes it even more of a visual mess. I’m including it here really just for the record and to illustrate that the first try at visualising something isn’t always the best (and sometimes, a humble bar chart ends up being what you want).

It’s difficult to interpret, and while it has a bit of extra information (which country the diaspora is in) this doesn’t outweigh the interpretation problems. it probably shouldn’t have a log scale as we really want to add up the numbers; but using a non-transformed scale makes it even more of a visual mess. I’m including it here really just for the record and to illustrate that the first try at visualising something isn’t always the best (and sometimes, a humble bar chart ends up being what you want).
