You can extend it later to xG models, Bayesian hierarchical models,\n      or time-varying strength. If you like Bayesian approaches, see:\nBayesian Sports Analytics (Book/Product)\n.\nGet match data\nThe easiest path is to pull historical match results from public sources.\n      With\nworldfootballR\n, you can often scrape league seasons from sources like FBref.\n      The specific function names can vary by package version/source, so below you’ll see:\nOption A:\nUse\nworldfootballR\ndirectly (recommended).\nOption B:\nUse your own CSV export if you already have data.\nOption A — Pull league season data with worldfootballR\nIf you need help with installation and authentication quirks, see:\nInstall & Use worldfootballR\n.\n# --- Option A (worldfootballR) ---\n# The exact workflow depends on the data source (FBref / other).\n# Typical pattern:\n# 1) Get competition URLs\n# 2) Pull match results for seasons\n#\n# PSEUDOCODE (adjust per your worldfootballR version):\n#\n# comp_urls <- fb_league_urls(country = \"ENG\", gender = \"M\", season_end_year = 2026)\n# epl_url <- comp_urls %>% filter(str_detect(Competition_Name, \"Premier League\")) %>% pull(Seasons_Urls) %>% .[1]\n#\n# matches <- fb_match_results(season_url = epl_url) %>%\n#   janitor::clean_names()\n#\n# head(matches)\nOption B — Use a CSV export (works everywhere)\nYour data needs (minimum):\ndate\n,\nhome_team\n,\naway_team\n,\nhome_goals\n,\naway_goals\n.\n      Save it as\nmatches.csv\n.\n# --- Option B (CSV) ---\nmatches <- readr::read_csv(\"matches.csv\") %>%\n  janitor::clean_names() %>%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(home_goals), !is.na(away_goals)) %>%\n  arrange(date)\n\ndplyr::glimpse(matches)\nStandardize columns\n# Make sure we have standardized column names\nmatches <- matches %>%\n  transmute(\n    date = as.Date(date),\n    season = if_else(month(date) >= 7, year(date) + 1L, year(date)), # football season heuristic\n    home = as.character(home_team),\n    away = as.character(away_team),\n    hg = as.integer(home_goals),\n    ag = as.integer(away_goals)\n  ) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(date), !is.na(home), !is.na(away), !is.na(hg), !is.na(ag)) %>%\n  arrange(date)\n\n# Basic sanity checks\nstopifnot(all(matches$hg >= 0), all(matches$ag >= 0))\nmatches %>% count(season) %>% arrange(desc(season)) %>% print(n = 50)\nFeature engineering\nFor a baseline Poisson model, we’ll estimate team strength through parameters:\nattack\nand\ndefense\n, plus a\nhome advantage\n.\n      We’ll also build rolling form features as optional enhancements.\nLong format for modeling\nlong <- matches %>%\n  mutate(match_id = row_number()) %>%\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(home, away),\n    names_to = \"side\",\n    values_to = \"team\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    opp = if_else(side == \"home\", away, home),\n    goals = if_else(side == \"home\", hg, ag),\n    conceded = if_else(side == \"home\", ag, hg),\n    is_home = as.integer(side == \"home\")\n  ) %>%\n  select(match_id, date, season, team, opp, is_home, goals, conceded)\n\nhead(long)\nOptional: rolling “form” features\nThese can help a bit, but don’t overfit.
