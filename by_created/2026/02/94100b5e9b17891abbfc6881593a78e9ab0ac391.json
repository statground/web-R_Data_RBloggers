How to recover from common mistakes\nDate\n: Thursday, March 19th, 14:00 – 16:00 CET (Rome, Berlin, Paris timezone)\nSpeaker\n: Maëlle Salmon, with a PhD in statistics, is a Research Software Engineer and blogger. At rOpenSci, she maintains the guide rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review, and has developed the babeldown and babelquarto packages for multilingual documents. At cynkra, she contributes to igraph and other packages. Maëlle is also the co-author of the book HTTP testing in R with Scott Chamberlain and created the R-hub blog. Additionally, she regularly contracts with various organizations, including research institutions, for R package development.\nDescription:\nGit is very useful. But it can also be scary when we make a mistake. Fortunately, with experience we make fewer mistakes… and/or we know better how to recover from them! In this hands-on workshop, we will learn how to get out of seven possible bad situations that can occur, with seven exercises inspired by the “Oh Shit, Git!” website https://ohshitgit.com/ and provided by the R package {saperlipopette}. https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/index.html By the end of this workshop, we’ll feel more capable of dealing with Git and our own fallibility.\nThis workshop is aimed at people who already have some experience using version control, although you don’t need to be an expert. It’s ideal for those who want to strengthen their confidence and autonomy in difficult situations.\nMinimal registration fee:\n20 euro (or 20 USD or 800 UAH)\nPlease note that the registration confirmation is sent 1 day before the workshop to all registered participants rather than immediately after registration\nHow can I register?\nGo to\nhttps://bit.ly/3wvwMA6\nor\nhttps://bit.ly/4aD5LMC\nor\nhttps://bit.ly/3PFxtNA\nand donate\nat least 20 euro\n.\nFeel free to donate more if you can, all proceeds go directly to support Ukraine.\nSave your donation receipt (after the donation is processed, there is an option to enter your email address on the website to which the donation receipt is sent)\nFill in the\nregistration form\n, attaching a screenshot of a donation receipt (please attach the screenshot of the donation receipt that was emailed to you rather than the page you see after donation).\nIf you are not personally interested in attending, you can also contribute by sponsoring a participation of a student, who will then be able to participate for free. If you choose to sponsor a student, all proceeds will also go directly to organisations working in Ukraine.
