Today, we can choose among:\n{nnet}\nfor classic, small-scale neural nets,\n{neuralnet}\nanother classic neural nets package besides\n{nnet}\n,\n{keras}\n/\n{keras3}\nfor the Keras API (typically with Python backends such as TensorFlow/JAX/Torch),\n{torch}\nfor native-R deep learning with explicit model and training control.\nSo why discuss another package?\nIn our experience, many day-to-day projects sit in the middle: we want more flexibility than a classical model, but less boilerplate than writing a full\n{torch}\ntraining loop.\n{kindling}\nis designed for that middle ground.\nIn this article, we focus on what\n{kindling}\ndoes well, where it helps, and where it is still limited.\nWhat problem\n{kindling}\nsolves (and what it does not)\n{kindling}\nis a higher-level interface built on top of\n{torch}\n. In practice, it reduces repetitive code for:\ndefining common network architectures,\ntraining feedforward and recurrent models,\nintegrating with\n{tidymodels}\n(\n{parsnip}\n,\n{recipes}\n,\n{workflows}\n,\n{tune}\n).\nIt does\nnot\nreplace low-level\n{torch}\nfor highly customized research code, and it does\nnot\nmake hardware setup disappear. You still need a working LibTorch installation and an environment that can use CPU/GPU properly.\nAt the time of writing (CRAN version 0.2.0), core built-in architectures include FFNN/MLP and recurrent variants (RNN/LSTM/GRU).\nSetup\nInstall this package in two different ways:\nSolely install\n{kindling}\n(as it installs the package dependencies internally)\ninstall.packages(\"kindling\")\nYou can install the package dependencies separately:\ninstall.packages(c(\n  \"kindling\",\n  # dependencies\n  \"torch\", \"dplyr\", \"rsample\", \"recipes\", \"yardstick\",\n  \"workflows\", \"parsnip\", \"tibble\", \"ggplot2\", \"mlbench\", \"vip\"\n))\nThen load the packages in two ways:\nUsing\nlibrary()\ntraditionally:\nlibrary(kindling)\nlibrary(torch)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(rsample)\nlibrary(recipes)\nlibrary(yardstick)\nlibrary(workflows)\nlibrary(parsnip)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mlbench)\nlibrary(vip)\nIn this article, we use\nlibrary()\nfor clarity and copy-paste reproducibility.\nIf you prefer a module-based and more explicit import style, use\nbox::use()\n(read\nBox: Placing module system into R\nfor more details).\nHere’s the equivalent code as above:\nbox::use(\nkindling[...],\ndplyr[...],\nrsample[...],\nrecipes[...],\nyardstick[...],\nworkflows[...],\nparsnip[...],\ntibble[...],\nggplot2[...],\nmlbench[...],\nvip[...]\n)\n{kindling}\nuses\n{torch}\nas backend, so LibTorch must be installed once:\nif (!torch::torch_is_installed()) {\n  torch::install_torch()\n}\nThree levels of interaction\n{kindling}\nis useful because you can work at different abstraction levels. Here are three ways to interact with the package, ordered from lowest to highest level of abstraction:\n1) Generate model code (\n*_generator()\n)\nIf you want to inspect architecture code before training:\nffnn_generator(\n  nn_name = \"MyNet\",\n  hd_neurons = c(64, 32, 16),\n  no_x = 10,\n  no_y = 1,\n  activations = act_funs(\n    relu,\n    \"softplus(beta = 0.5)\",\n    selu\n  )\n)\n## torch::nn_module(\"MyNet\", initialize = function () \n## {\n##     self$fc1 = torch::nn_linear(10, 64, bias = TRUE)\n##     self$fc2 = torch::nn_linear(64, 32, bias = TRUE)\n##     self$fc3 = torch::nn_linear(32, 16, bias = TRUE)\n##     self$out = torch::nn_linear(16, 1, bias = TRUE)\n## }, forward = function (x) \n## {\n##     x = self$fc1(x)\n##     x = torch::nnf_relu(x)\n##     x = self$fc2(x)\n##     x = torch::nnf_softplus(x, beta = 0.5)\n##     x = self$fc3(x)\n##     x = torch::nnf_selu(x)\n##     x = self$out(x)\n##     x\n## })\nTechnical note: To specify a parametric activation functions like\nSoftplus\nunder\nact_funs()\nfunction, set\nsoftplus = args(beta = 0.5)\nor\nsoftplus[beta = 0.5]\n(available in v0.3.x and later), not just in a stringly typed expression, e.g.\n\"softplus(beta = 0.5)\"\n.\nThis returns an unevaluated\ntorch::nn_module\nexpression you can inspect or modify.\n2) Direct Training\nThe functions available (for now) are\nffnn()\nand\nrnn()\n. For many applied tasks, this is the fastest way to fit a network from a formula.\nmini_direct <- ffnn(\n  mpg ~ .,\n  data = mtcars,\n  hidden_neurons = 8,\n  activations = act_funs(relu),\n  epochs = 20,\n  verbose = FALSE\n)\n\npredict(mini_direct, newdata = head(mtcars, 3))\n## [1] 11.21900 11.21385 10.56841\n3) ML Framework Integration:\n{tidymodels}\nwith\nmlp_kindling()\n/\nrnn_kindling()\n{kindling}\nfunctions to directly train the said models also (currently) integrates with\n{tidymodels}\n. This level is ideal when we want recipes, workflows, resampling, and tuning.\nmini_spec <- mlp_kindling(\n  mode = \"regression\",\n  hidden_neurons = 8,\n  activations = act_funs(relu), # or just \"relu\"\n  epochs = 20,\n  verbose = FALSE\n)\n\nmini_wf <- workflow() |>\n  add_formula(mpg ~ .) |>\n  add_model(mini_spec)\n\nmini_fit <- fit(mini_wf, data = mtcars)\n\npredict(mini_fit, new_data = head(mtcars, 3))\n## # A tibble: 3 × 1\n##   .pred\n##   <dbl>\n## 1 -3.49\n## 2 -3.50\n## 3 -3.50\nNow that we’ve covered the three levels of interaction, let’s see\n{kindling}\nin action with two “realistic” examples. We’ll demonstrate how to structure reproducible workflows, handle feature preprocessing, and evaluate results properly. Along the way, you’ll see which abstraction level works best for different scenarios.\nExample 1: Iris classification with reproducible good practice\nThis first example uses direct training with\nffnn()\n, but still follows practical steps:\ntrain/test split,\nfeature scaling,\nvalidation split during training,\nregularization,\nout-of-sample evaluation.\nData Preprocessing\nTrain/test split\nis performed to prevent evaluating only on training data.\ndata(iris)\n\niris_split <- initial_split(iris, prop = 0.8, strata = Species)\niris_train <- training(iris_split)\niris_test <- testing(iris_split)\n\niris_recipe <- recipe(Species ~ ., data = iris_train) |>\n  step_normalize(all_predictors())\niris_prep <- prep(iris_recipe, training = iris_train)\niris_train_processed <- bake(iris_prep, new_data = NULL)\niris_test_processed <- bake(iris_prep, new_data = iris_test)\nMLP with 2 Hidden Layers\nset.seed(20260218)\n\niris_mlp <- ffnn(\n  Species ~ .,\n  data = iris_train_processed,\n  hidden_neurons = c(32, 16),\n  activations = act_funs(relu, \"softplus(beta = 0.5)\"),\n  loss = \"cross_entropy\",\n  optimizer = \"adam\",\n  learn_rate = 0.01,\n  penalty = 1e-4,\n  mixture = 0,\n  batch_size = 16,\n  epochs = 200,\n  validation_split = 0.2,\n  verbose = FALSE\n)\n\niris_mlp\n## \n## ======================= Feedforward Neural Networks (MLP) ======================\n## \n## \n## -- FFNN Model Summary ----------------------------------------------------------\n## \n## \n## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n##   NN Model Type           :             FFNN    n_predictors :                    4\n##   Number of Epochs        :              200    n_response   :                    3\n##   Hidden Layer Units      :           32, 16    reg.         :   [λ = 1e-04, α = 0]\n##   Number of Hidden Layers :                2    Device       :                  mps\n##   Pred.

It is enough capacity for Iris, but still simple.\nActivations\n: The architecture has 2 hidden layers, each layer is specified with different activation functions.\nrelu\n: Also called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU); the most stable default for hidden layers.\nsoftplus\n: Similar to ReLU but much\nsmoother\nin approximation; beta is adjusted to\n0.5\n.\nScaling\n: crucial because neural networks are sensitive to predictor scale.\nRegularization (\npenalty\nand\nmixture\n)\n: helps reduce overfitting even on small data.\nmixture\nis set to 0, which means the optimization is performed with L2 regularization.\nValidation split\n: monitors generalization during training.\nExample 2: A more realistic tabular benchmark (Sonar)\nIris is useful for teaching, but sometimes considered (too) easy. The Sonar dataset (60 numeric predictors, binary outcome) is a better stress test for tabular classification.\ndata(\"Sonar\", package = \"mlbench\")\n\nsonar <- Sonar |>\n  mutate(Class = factor(Class))\n\nsonar_split <- initial_split(sonar, prop = 0.8, strata = Class)\nsonar_train <- training(sonar_split)\nsonar_test <- testing(sonar_split)\nNow fit through\n{tidymodels}\nso preprocessing and modeling stay in one pipeline:\nsonar_rec <- recipe(Class ~ ., data = sonar_train) |>\n  step_normalize(all_predictors())\n\nsonar_spec <- mlp_kindling(\n  mode = \"classification\",\n  hidden_neurons = c(64, 32),\n  activations = act_funs(relu, relu),\n  optimizer = \"adam\",\n  learn_rate = 0.001,\n  penalty = 1e-4,\n  mixture = 0,\n  batch_size = 16,\n  epochs = 250,\n  validation_split = 0.2,\n  verbose = FALSE\n)\n\nsonar_wf <- workflow() |>\n  add_recipe(sonar_rec) |>\n  add_model(sonar_spec)\n\nset.seed(20260218)\nsonar_fit <- fit(sonar_wf, data = sonar_train)\nsonar_pred <- augment(sonar_fit, new_data = sonar_test)\n\nmetrics(sonar_pred, truth = Class, estimate = .pred_class)\n## # A tibble: 2 × 3\n##   .metric  .estimator .estimate\n##   <chr>    <chr>          <dbl>\n## 1 accuracy binary         0.837\n## 2 kap      binary         0.672\nIn practice, this setup is often a strong baseline for tabular binary classification before trying larger architectures.\nAbout early stopping and callbacks\nIf you come from Keras/TensorFlow, you may be used to callback objects (early stopping, learning-rate schedules, etc.).\nWith\n{kindling}\n0.2.0, practical overfitting control is usually handled through:\nvalidation_split\n,\nregularization (\npenalty\n,\nmixture\n),\ntuning model size and training length (\nepochs\n),\nproper resampling with\n{tidymodels}\n.\nIn other words, we can approximate early-stopping behavior by selecting\nepochs\nvia validation/resampling, even without a callback-heavy workflow.\nSupported architectures (current scope)\nArchitecture\nMain function(s)\nTypical use\nFeedforward (MLP/FFNN)\nffnn(), mlp_kindling()\nTabular regression/classification\nRNN\nrnn_kindling(rnn_type = \"rnn\")\nSequential patterns\nLSTM\nrnn_kindling(rnn_type = \"lstm\")\nLonger-range sequence dependencies\nGRU\nrnn_kindling(rnn_type = \"gru\")\nSequence modeling with fewer parameters\nVariable importance (FFNN)\nInterpretability for neural networks is imperfect, but\n{kindling}\nintegrates established approaches for FFNN models.\n# For FFNN fits:\ngarson(iris_mlp, bar_plot = FALSE)\n##        x_names y_names  rel_imp\n## 1 Petal.Length       y 33.39467\n## 2  Sepal.Width       y 24.44282\n## 3  Petal.Width       y 21.92705\n## 4 Sepal.Length       y 20.23546\nolden(iris_mlp, bar_plot = FALSE)\n##        x_names y_names    rel_imp\n## 1 Petal.Length       y -2.4176215\n## 2  Petal.Width       y -1.8339908\n## 3 Sepal.Length       y -0.6675719\n## 4  Sepal.Width       y  0.5844613\n# Via vip (Olden/Garson methods supported by kindling S3 methods)\nvi(iris_mlp, type = \"olden\") |>\n  vip()\nWe recommend using these as directional diagnostics, not as causal evidence.\nWhen\n{kindling}\nis a good fit\n{kindling}\nis a practical choice when our projects:\nwork mostly in R and want to stay inside\n{tidymodels}\n,\nneed neural nets for tabular or moderate sequence tasks,\nwant less boilerplate than raw\n{torch}\nbut still meaningful control.\nIt may be less ideal when our projects need:\ncustom research architectures and training loops,\nmature callback ecosystems similar to high-level Keras workflows,\nhighly optimized distributed production pipelines.\nLimitations to keep in mind\nHardware setup still matters\n: GPU usage depends on a correct\n{torch}\n/LibTorch installation and supported hardware.\nEcosystem maturity\n: this is a young package; interfaces can evolve.\nDebugging depth\n: for deeply custom debugging, low-level\n{torch}\nremains the reference path.\nModel class assumptions\n: recurrent models are for sequence-structured data; using them on plain tabular data is usually not appropriate.\nTakeaways\n{kindling}\nis not about replacing\n{torch}\nor\n{keras3}\n. It is about reducing friction for common deep-learning workflows in R.\nFor many applied projects, a robust pattern is:\npreprocess with\n{recipes}\n,\nstart with a modest MLP architecture,\nuse validation split + regularization,\nevaluate on held-out test data,\ntune only after you have a strong baseline.\nIf this matches your workflow,\n{kindling}\nis worth trying.\nAs always, if you have any question related to the topic covered in this post, please add it as a comment so other readers can benefit from the discussion.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nR on Stats and R\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
