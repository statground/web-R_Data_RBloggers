Now let’s dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!\nrOpenSci HQ\nStrong Engagement in the Champions Program Call\nThe Champions Program call closed on February 23, and the response\nwas fantastic\n. We received\n81 Champion\nand\n14 Mentor applications\nfrom\n23 countries\n, with\n74%\nof applicants proposing to develop a\nnew package\n. We’re now kicking off the selection process, starting with mentors so they can support the evaluation of Champion proposals. Confirmation emails have already been sent to all applicants. Thank you to everyone who applied!\nPolicy Updates for use of Generative AI Tools\nWe published an\ninitial blog post\nabout planned updates to our policies and practices for use of generative AI tools in rOpenSci packages. This follows recent policy updates at both the\nJournal of Open Source Software\nand\npyOpenSci\n. We are seeking feedback on the\nblog post\n, and on the policy changes proposed there, via\nthis decidated GitHub issue\n. The blog explains our intention to permit the use of generative AI tools throughout package development, and during the review process. Our policies aim to maintain our culture of openness and transparency, and we have already started informally asking submitting authors about any use of generative AI tools.\nCoworking\nRead\nall about coworking\n!\nTuesday March 3rd 2026, 14:00 Europe Central (13:00 UTC),\n“rOpenSci Editors”\nwith\nSteffi LaZerte\nand cohost\nMark Padgham\n.\nLearn more about\nrOpenSci Software Peer Review\nMeet cohost Mark Padgham, and discuss what it’s like being an Editor for rOpenSci Software Peer Review.\nTuesday April 7th 2026, 9:00 Americas Pacific (16:00 UTC)\n“Getting to know the CSID Network”\nwith\nSteffi LaZerte\nand cohost\nIrene Ramos\n.\nLearn more about the\nCSID Network\nMeet cohost, Irene Ramos, and learn more about the CSID Network and how you might get involved.\nTuesday May 5th 2026, 9:00 Australia Western (01:00 UTC)\n“Code Review with rOpenSci”\nwith\nSteffi LaZerte\nand cohost\nLiz Hare\n.\nExplore resources for Code Review\nSign up to volunteer to do\nsoftware peer-review\nat rOpenSci\nMeet cohost, Liz Hare, and discuss resources for Code Review with rOpenSci.\nAnd remember, you can always cowork independently on work related to R, work on packages that tend to be neglected, or work on what ever you need to get done!\nCommunity Dashboard for your own R-Universe\nLast year we published a\nblog post\non an\norganization-level dashboard\nfor all rOpenSci packages and community contributors.
