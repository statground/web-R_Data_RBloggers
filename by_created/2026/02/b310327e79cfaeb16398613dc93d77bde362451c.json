Teams change. Injuries happen. Upsets happen. But uncertainty is not the enemy—it’s the input. In this hands-on guide you’ll build a practical sports prediction workflow in\nR\nusing\ntidyverse\n,\nPlayerRatings\n, and\nNFLSimulatoR\n, then connect ratings to\nMonte Carlo simulations\nand\nforecasting models\n(logistic regression & Poisson).\nGoal\nProbabilities, not “picks”\nCore tools\nRatings + Models + Simulation\nOutput\nReproducible code & scenarios\nTable of Contents\n1) Setup: a reproducible R project\n2) A tiny dataset (so we can focus on methods)\n3) Elo ratings with PlayerRatings\n4) Glicko ratings (when uncertainty matters)\n5) Turning ratings into win probabilities\n6) Monte Carlo: simulate a season & playoff odds\n7) “What-if” analysis: injuries, transfers, roster changes\n8) Poisson models for scorelines\n9) Logistic regression for match outcomes\n10) Using NFLSimulatoR as a simulator backbone\n11) Evaluation: calibration + proper scoring\n12) Wrap-up: a practical workflow you can reuse\nEverything below is meant to be copied into an R script and run. Swap the toy data for your league’s data (football/soccer, basketball, American football, tennis, baseball, esports—you name it).\n1) Setup: a reproducible R project\nPrediction work gets messy fast if you can’t reproduce it. Start every project with: (1) a clean package setup, (2) a fixed random seed, (3) tidy data conventions.\n# Install (run once)\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"lubridate\", \"PlayerRatings\"))\n\n# If you plan to use NFLSimulatoR (CRAN/GitHub availability varies):\n# install.packages(\"NFLSimulatoR\") \n# or, if needed:\n# install.packages(\"remotes\"); remotes::install_github(\".../NFLSimulatoR\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(PlayerRatings)\n\nset.seed(2026)  # reproducibility: simulation + model splits will match\nRule of thumb:\nif your analysis can’t be rerun end-to-end from a fresh session, it’s not ready for decisions (betting, scouting, or strategy).\n2) A tiny dataset (so we can focus on methods)\nWe’ll build a compact match table with team names, dates, and outcomes. You can replace this with real data later (e.g., football leagues, NBA games, tennis matches).\n# Create toy match results\nteams <- c(\"Lions\", \"Tigers\", \"Bears\", \"Wolves\", \"Hawks\", \"Sharks\")\n\nn_games <- 120\n\nmatches <- tibble(\n  date  = sample(seq.Date(as.Date(\"2025-08-01\"), as.Date(\"2026-01-31\"), by = \"day\"), n_games, replace = TRUE),\n  home  = sample(teams, n_games, replace = TRUE),\n  away  = sample(teams, n_games, replace = TRUE)\n) %>%\n  filter(home != away) %>%\n  arrange(date) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # \"true\" (hidden) team strengths to generate outcomes (toy world)\n    home_strength = recode(home,\n      \"Lions\"=0.6,\"Tigers\"=0.5,\"Bears\"=0.4,\"Wolves\"=0.2,\"Hawks\"=0.1,\"Sharks\"=0.0),\n    away_strength = recode(away,\n      \"Lions\"=0.6,\"Tigers\"=0.5,\"Bears\"=0.4,\"Wolves\"=0.2,\"Hawks\"=0.1,\"Sharks\"=0.0),\n\n    # Convert strength difference into a win probability\n    p_home = plogis(0.4 + 2.0*(home_strength - away_strength)),  # home advantage + skill gap\n    home_win = rbinom(n(), size = 1, prob = p_home)\n  ) %>%\n  select(date, home, away, home_win, p_home)\n\nmatches %>% slice(1:8)\nThis is intentionally minimal: just enough to demonstrate Elo/Glicko, win probabilities, simulation, and modeling.\n3) Elo ratings with PlayerRatings\nElo is a rating system that updates after each game. It’s not “magic”—it’s a controlled way to: (1) estimate team strength from history, and (2) turn rating gaps into expected win probabilities.\n3.1 Prepare the input format\n# PlayerRatings expects a \"competitionResult\" object.\n# We'll represent teams as \"players\" and each game as a head-to-head match.\n\nelo_input <- matches %>%\n  transmute(\n    Date = date,\n    Player1 = home,\n    Player2 = away,\n    # For PlayerRatings: 1 = Player1 win, 0 = Player2 win (or use Score columns)\n    Result = if_else(home_win == 1, 1, 0)\n  )\n\nhead(elo_input)\n3.2 Fit Elo\n# Run Elo with a K-factor (update speed). Tune K by sport and data volume.\nelo_fit <- elo(elo_input, k = 20)\n\n# Ratings after processing all games\nelo_ratings <- as.data.frame(elo_fit$ratings) %>%\n  rownames_to_column(\"team\") %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  rename(elo = Rating) %>%\n  arrange(desc(elo))\n\nelo_ratings\nWhy Elo is useful:\nit’s lightweight, interpretable, and often surprisingly competitive as a baseline. Use it to sanity-check more complex models.\n4) Glicko ratings (when uncertainty matters)\nElo tells you “strength.” Glicko tells you “strength + uncertainty.” Early season? New team? Few games played? Glicko’s rating deviation helps you avoid false confidence.\n# Glicko uses a similar input, but the function differs (depends on PlayerRatings version).\n# Many workflows look like this:\n\nglicko_input <- elo_input  # same structure works for many head-to-head methods\n\n# Some installs provide a glicko() function:\n# glicko_fit <- glicko(glicko_input)\n\n# If your PlayerRatings build doesn't expose glicko() directly,\n# you can still rely on Elo for the main pipeline and add uncertainty via modeling/simulation.\n\n# Pseudo-example structure:\n# glicko_ratings <- glicko_fit$ratings\nHeads-up:\npackage APIs can change. If your local PlayerRatings version doesn’t expose a direct\nglicko()\nhelper, you can still do uncertainty-aware prediction by combining ratings with a probabilistic model (logistic regression/Bayesian) and then simulating forward.\n5) Turning ratings into win probabilities\nRatings become actionable once you map them to probabilities. The classic Elo expectation uses a logistic curve. You can also learn this mapping empirically (recommended) by fitting a model on past games.\n5.1 Join Elo back into match rows\nmatches_w_elo <- matches %>%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %>% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %>% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  mutate(elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo)\n\nmatches_w_elo %>% select(date, home, away, home_win, home_elo, away_elo, elo_diff) %>% slice(1:10)\n5.2 A simple Elo-to-probability mapping\n# Classic Elo expected score mapping (base-10 logistic).\n# \"scale\" controls steepness. For chess Elo it's 400 by convention.\nelo_prob <- function(diff, scale = 400) {\n  1 / (1 + 10^(-diff / scale))\n}\n\nmatches_w_elo <- matches_w_elo %>%\n  mutate(p_home_elo = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250))  # scale tuned for our toy world\n\nmatches_w_elo %>%\n  summarize(\n    avg_p = mean(p_home_elo),\n    brier = mean((home_win - p_home_elo)^2)\n  )\nElo gives a baseline probability. Next we’ll simulate seasons, then we’ll improve the mapping using regression models.\n6) Monte Carlo: simulate a season & playoff odds\nMonte Carlo simulation is how you turn game probabilities into season-level questions: “What are the chances we finish top-2?” “How often do we make playoffs?” “What is the distribution of wins?”\n6.1 Build a future schedule\n# Create a \"future\" schedule (e.g., the next 60 games)\nn_future <- 60\nfuture <- tibble(\n  date = seq.Date(as.Date(\"2026-02-01\"), by = \"day\", length.out = n_future),\n  home = sample(teams, n_future, replace = TRUE),\n  away = sample(teams, n_future, replace = TRUE)\n) %>%\n  filter(home != away) %>%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %>% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %>% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250)\n  )\n\nfuture %>% slice(1:8)\n6.2 Simulate the remaining season many times\nsimulate_season <- function(future_games, n_sims = 5000) {\n\n  # We'll simulate all games n_sims times, then compute win totals.\n  sims <- replicate(n_sims, {\n    future_games %>%\n      mutate(home_win = rbinom(n(), 1, p_home)) %>%\n      transmute(\n        home, away,\n        home_w = home_win,\n        away_w = 1 - home_win\n      ) %>%\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(home, away), names_to = \"side\", values_to = \"team\") %>%\n      mutate(win = if_else(side == \"home\", home_w, away_w)) %>%\n      group_by(team) %>%\n      summarize(wins = sum(win), .groups = \"drop\")\n  }, simplify = FALSE)\n\n  bind_rows(sims, .id = \"sim\") %>%\n    mutate(sim = as.integer(sim))\n}\n\nseason_sims <- simulate_season(future, n_sims = 3000)\n\n# Win distribution by team\nwin_dist <- season_sims %>%\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  summarize(\n    avg_wins = mean(wins),\n    p_top2 = mean(rank(-wins, ties.method = \"random\") <= 2),\n    p_top3 = mean(rank(-wins, ties.method = \"random\") <= 3),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(avg_wins))\n\nwin_dist\nInterpretation tip:\nsimulation answers “distribution” questions (ranges, tails, chances). That’s exactly what decision-makers care about.\n7) “What-if” analysis: injuries, transfers, roster changes\nCounterfactuals are where modeling becomes practical: you modify team strength assumptions and see how outcomes shift. For Elo-based pipelines, this is as easy as adding/subtracting rating points.\n# Example: star injury reduces Lions by 60 Elo points for the rest of the season\nadjusted_ratings <- elo_ratings %>%\n  mutate(elo_adj = if_else(team == \"Lions\", elo - 60, elo))\n\nfuture_counterfactual <- future %>%\n  select(date, home, away) %>%\n  left_join(adjusted_ratings %>% select(team, home_elo = elo_adj), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  left_join(adjusted_ratings %>% select(team, away_elo = elo_adj), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250)\n  )\n\nbaseline <- simulate_season(future, n_sims = 2000) %>% mutate(scenario = \"baseline\")\ninjury   <- simulate_season(future_counterfactual, n_sims = 2000) %>% mutate(scenario = \"lions_injury\")\n\ncompare <- bind_rows(baseline, injury) %>%\n  group_by(scenario, team) %>%\n  summarize(avg_wins = mean(wins), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = scenario, values_from = avg_wins) %>%\n  mutate(delta = lions_injury - baseline) %>%\n  arrange(delta)\n\ncompare\nThe same idea works for transfers, coaching changes, or “rest days”—anything you can reasonably encode as a strength shift.\n8) Poisson models for scorelines\nWhen you predict scores (not just win/loss), Poisson models are a strong baseline—especially in low-scoring sports. The classic setup models goals scored as Poisson with attack/defense effects and home advantage.\n8.1 Generate toy score data\n# Create toy goals (home_goals, away_goals) driven by hidden strengths.\n# This mimics soccer/hockey-like scoring.\n\nscores <- matches %>%\n  mutate(\n    lambda_home = exp(-0.2 + 1.2*home_strength - 0.9*away_strength + 0.25),\n    lambda_away = exp(-0.2 + 1.2*away_strength - 0.9*home_strength),\n    home_goals = rpois(n(), lambda_home),\n    away_goals = rpois(n(), lambda_away),\n    home_win = as.integer(home_goals > away_goals),\n    draw = as.integer(home_goals == away_goals)\n  ) %>%\n  select(date, home, away, home_goals, away_goals, home_win, draw)\n\nscores %>% slice(1:8)\n8.2 Fit Poisson GLMs\n# Two-model approach: predict home_goals and away_goals separately.\n# Features: team identifiers (as factors) can capture attack/defense proxies in simple form.\n\npo_home <- glm(home_goals ~ home + away, data = scores, family = poisson())\npo_away <- glm(away_goals ~ home + away, data = scores, family = poisson())\n\n# Predict expected goals for upcoming games\nfuture_xg <- future %>%\n  select(date, home, away) %>%\n  mutate(\n    xg_home = predict(po_home, newdata = ., type = \"response\"),\n    xg_away = predict(po_away, newdata = ., type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nfuture_xg %>% slice(1:8)\n8.3 Convert expected goals into win probabilities\n# Approximate match outcome probabilities by simulating scorelines from the Poisson rates.\nscoreline_probs <- function(lambda_home, lambda_away, n = 20000) {\n  hg <- rpois(n, lambda_home)\n  ag <- rpois(n, lambda_away)\n  tibble(\n    p_home_win = mean(hg > ag),\n    p_draw     = mean(hg == ag),\n    p_away_win = mean(hg < ag)\n  )\n}\n\nexample_probs <- scoreline_probs(future_xg$xg_home[1], future_xg$xg_away[1], n = 30000)\nexample_probs\nWhy this works:\nif you can forecast scoring rates, you can forecast any downstream event: win, draw, total goals, both-teams-to-score, etc.\n9) Logistic regression for match outcomes\nA clean upgrade from “raw Elo mapping” is to fit a logistic regression that learns how rating differences translate to win probability—optionally adding context features (rest, travel, injuries, lineup quality).\n# Train on historical matches: outcome ~ elo_diff\ntrain <- matches_w_elo %>% drop_na(home_elo, away_elo)\n\nlogit <- glm(home_win ~ elo_diff, data = train, family = binomial())\nsummary(logit)\n\n# Predict probabilities for future games using the fitted mapping\nfuture_logit <- future %>%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %>% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %>% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = predict(logit, newdata = ., type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nfuture_logit %>% slice(1:8)\nLogistic regression also makes it easy to incorporate additional predictors beyond ratings.\n10) Using NFLSimulatoR as a simulator backbone\nIf you’re working on American football specifically, a purpose-built simulator can accelerate your pipeline: schedule generation, game simulation, season simulation, and standings logic.\nNote:\nThe exact function names can differ depending on the NFLSimulatoR version you have. The pattern below shows a practical structure you can adapt: prepare team strengths → simulate games → aggregate standings → repeat.\n# library(NFLSimulatoR)\n\n# 1) Define (or estimate) team strength inputs\nteam_strengths <- elo_ratings %>% select(team, elo)\n\n# 2) Build or import a schedule (week, home, away)\n# nfl_schedule <- NFLSimulatoR::load_schedule(season = 2026)\n# or your own:\nnfl_schedule <- tibble(\n  week = rep(1:10, each = 3),\n  home = sample(teams, 30, replace = TRUE),\n  away = sample(teams, 30, replace = TRUE)\n) %>% filter(home != away)\n\n# 3) Map strengths to win probs (Elo-based or model-based)\nnfl_games <- nfl_schedule %>%\n  left_join(team_strengths %>% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  left_join(team_strengths %>% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250)\n  )\n\n# 4) Simulate a season many times\nsimulate_nfl_like <- function(games, n_sims = 5000) {\n  sims <- replicate(n_sims, {\n    games %>%\n      mutate(home_win = rbinom(n(), 1, p_home)) %>%\n      transmute(home, away, home_w = home_win, away_w = 1 - home_win) %>%\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(home, away), names_to = \"side\", values_to = \"team\") %>%\n      mutate(win = if_else(side == \"home\", home_w, away_w)) %>%\n      group_by(team) %>%\n      summarize(wins = sum(win), .groups = \"drop\")\n  }, simplify = FALSE)\n\n  bind_rows(sims, .id = \"sim\") %>%\n    mutate(sim = as.integer(sim))\n}\n\nnfl_sims <- simulate_nfl_like(nfl_games, n_sims = 3000)\n\nnfl_summary <- nfl_sims %>%\n  group_by(team) %>%\n  summarize(\n    avg_wins = mean(wins),\n    p_10plus = mean(wins >= 10),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(avg_wins))\n\nnfl_summary\nKey idea:\nyou don’t need a “perfect” game model to get useful season-level probabilities. A reasonable win-probability engine + Monte Carlo is already powerful.\n11) Evaluation: calibration + proper scoring\nIn prediction, accuracy alone is not enough. You want probabilities that are well-calibrated and score well under proper scoring rules (Brier score, log loss).\n11.1 Brier score\nbrier_score <- function(y, p) mean((y - p)^2)\n\n# Compare Elo mapping vs logistic regression mapping (on the same historical set)\neval_tbl <- train %>%\n  mutate(\n    p_elo   = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250),\n    p_logit = predict(logit, newdata = ., type = \"response\")\n  ) %>%\n  summarize(\n    brier_elo = brier_score(home_win, p_elo),\n    brier_logit = brier_score(home_win, p_logit)\n  )\n\neval_tbl\n11.2 Calibration table (quick check)\ncalibration_table <- function(y, p, bins = 10) {\n  tibble(y = y, p = p) %>%\n    mutate(bin = ntile(p, bins)) %>%\n    group_by(bin) %>%\n    summarize(\n      p_avg = mean(p),\n      y_avg = mean(y),\n      n = n(),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n}\n\ncalib <- train %>%\n  mutate(p_logit = predict(logit, newdata = ., type = \"response\")) %>%\n  calibration_table(y = home_win, p = p_logit, bins = 10)\n\ncalib\nInterpretation:\nIn each probability bin, the average predicted probability should roughly match the observed win rate. If not, your model is miscalibrated (common—and fixable).\n12) Wrap-up: a practical workflow you can reuse\nHere’s the repeatable blueprint you just built:\nIngest results\ninto a tidy match table (one row per game).\nEstimate strengths\n(Elo/Glicko or similar).\nMap strengths → probabilities\n(Elo curve or a fitted logistic model).\nSimulate forward\nwith Monte Carlo for season and playoff probabilities.\nRun counterfactuals\nby adjusting strengths or model features.\nEvaluate\nwith proper scoring and calibration checks.\nIf you liked this approach and want a compact, hands-on walkthrough that stitches these pieces into a single practical learning path—ratings (Elo/Glicko), Monte Carlo seasons/tournaments, and forecasting models with runnable R code— you can find a focused guide here:\nSports Prediction and Simulation with R\n.\nIt’s built to be “open it, run the code, understand the method”—so you can apply the same pipeline to football, basketball, American football, tennis, baseball, esports, and beyond.\nDisclaimer: This article is educational and focuses on modeling and simulation techniques. Real-world performance depends on data quality, league structure, and how well your features capture the game.\nThe post\nHow to Predict Sports in R: Elo, Monte Carlo, and Real Simulations\nappeared first on\nR Programming Books\n.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nBlog - R Programming Books\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",

Swap the toy data for your league’s data (football/soccer, basketball, American football, tennis, baseball, esports—you name it).</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) Setup: a reproducible R project</h2>\n<p>Prediction work gets messy fast if you can’t reproduce it. Start every project with: (1) a clean package setup, (2) a fixed random seed, (3) tidy data conventions.</p>\n<pre># Install (run once)\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"lubridate\", \"PlayerRatings\"))\n\n# If you plan to use NFLSimulatoR (CRAN/GitHub availability varies):\n# install.packages(\"NFLSimulatoR\") \n# or, if needed:\n# install.packages(\"remotes\"); remotes::install_github(\".../NFLSimulatoR\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(PlayerRatings)\n\nset.seed(2026)  # reproducibility: simulation + model splits will match</pre>\n<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> if your analysis can’t be rerun end-to-end from a fresh session, it’s not ready for decisions (betting, scouting, or strategy).</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) A tiny dataset (so we can focus on methods)</h2>\n<p>We’ll build a compact match table with team names, dates, and outcomes. You can replace this with real data later (e.g., football leagues, NBA games, tennis matches).</p>\n<pre># Create toy match results\nteams &lt;- c(\"Lions\", \"Tigers\", \"Bears\", \"Wolves\", \"Hawks\", \"Sharks\")\n\nn_games &lt;- 120\n\nmatches &lt;- tibble(\n  date  = sample(seq.Date(as.Date(\"2025-08-01\"), as.Date(\"2026-01-31\"), by = \"day\"), n_games, replace = TRUE),\n  home  = sample(teams, n_games, replace = TRUE),\n  away  = sample(teams, n_games, replace = TRUE)\n) %&gt;%\n  filter(home != away) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # \"true\" (hidden) team strengths to generate outcomes (toy world)\n    home_strength = recode(home,\n      \"Lions\"=0.6,\"Tigers\"=0.5,\"Bears\"=0.4,\"Wolves\"=0.2,\"Hawks\"=0.1,\"Sharks\"=0.0),\n    away_strength = recode(away,\n      \"Lions\"=0.6,\"Tigers\"=0.5,\"Bears\"=0.4,\"Wolves\"=0.2,\"Hawks\"=0.1,\"Sharks\"=0.0),\n\n    # Convert strength difference into a win probability\n    p_home = plogis(0.4 + 2.0*(home_strength - away_strength)),  # home advantage + skill gap\n    home_win = rbinom(n(), size = 1, prob = p_home)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(date, home, away, home_win, p_home)\n\nmatches %&gt;% slice(1:8)</pre>\n<p>This is intentionally minimal: just enough to demonstrate Elo/Glicko, win probabilities, simulation, and modeling.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) Elo ratings with PlayerRatings</h2>\n<p>Elo is a rating system that updates after each game. It’s not “magic”—it’s a controlled way to: (1) estimate team strength from history, and (2) turn rating gaps into expected win probabilities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.1 Prepare the input format</h3>\n<pre># PlayerRatings expects a \"competitionResult\" object.\n# We'll represent teams as \"players\" and each game as a head-to-head match.\n\nelo_input &lt;- matches %&gt;%\n  transmute(\n    Date = date,\n    Player1 = home,\n    Player2 = away,\n    # For PlayerRatings: 1 = Player1 win, 0 = Player2 win (or use Score columns)\n    Result = if_else(home_win == 1, 1, 0)\n  )\n\nhead(elo_input)</pre>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.2 Fit Elo</h3>\n<pre># Run Elo with a K-factor (update speed). Tune K by sport and data volume.\nelo_fit &lt;- elo(elo_input, k = 20)\n\n# Ratings after processing all games\nelo_ratings &lt;- as.data.frame(elo_fit$ratings) %&gt;%\n  rownames_to_column(\"team\") %&gt;%\n  as_tibble() %&gt;%\n  rename(elo = Rating) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(elo))\n\nelo_ratings</pre>\n<p><strong>Why Elo is useful:</strong> it’s lightweight, interpretable, and often surprisingly competitive as a baseline. Use it to sanity-check more complex models.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4) Glicko ratings (when uncertainty matters)</h2>\n<p>Elo tells you “strength.” Glicko tells you “strength + uncertainty.” Early season? New team? Few games played? Glicko’s rating deviation helps you avoid false confidence.</p>\n<pre># Glicko uses a similar input, but the function differs (depends on PlayerRatings version).\n# Many workflows look like this:\n\nglicko_input &lt;- elo_input  # same structure works for many head-to-head methods\n\n# Some installs provide a glicko() function:\n# glicko_fit &lt;- glicko(glicko_input)\n\n# If your PlayerRatings build doesn't expose glicko() directly,\n# you can still rely on Elo for the main pipeline and add uncertainty via modeling/simulation.\n\n# Pseudo-example structure:\n# glicko_ratings &lt;- glicko_fit$ratings</pre>\n<p><strong>Heads-up:</strong> package APIs can change. If your local PlayerRatings version doesn’t expose a direct <code>glicko()</code> helper, you can still do uncertainty-aware prediction by combining ratings with a probabilistic model (logistic regression/Bayesian) and then simulating forward.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5) Turning ratings into win probabilities</h2>\n<p>Ratings become actionable once you map them to probabilities. The classic Elo expectation uses a logistic curve. You can also learn this mapping empirically (recommended) by fitting a model on past games.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.1 Join Elo back into match rows</h3>\n<pre>matches_w_elo &lt;- matches %&gt;%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %&gt;% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %&gt;% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo)\n\nmatches_w_elo %&gt;% select(date, home, away, home_win, home_elo, away_elo, elo_diff) %&gt;% slice(1:10)</pre>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.2 A simple Elo-to-probability mapping</h3>\n<pre># Classic Elo expected score mapping (base-10 logistic).\n# \"scale\" controls steepness. For chess Elo it's 400 by convention.\nelo_prob &lt;- function(diff, scale = 400) {\n  1 / (1 + 10^(-diff / scale))\n}\n\nmatches_w_elo &lt;- matches_w_elo %&gt;%\n  mutate(p_home_elo = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250))  # scale tuned for our toy world\n\nmatches_w_elo %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    avg_p = mean(p_home_elo),\n    brier = mean((home_win - p_home_elo)^2)\n  )</pre>\n<p>Elo gives a baseline probability. Next we’ll simulate seasons, then we’ll improve the mapping using regression models.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6) Monte Carlo: simulate a season &amp; playoff odds</h2>\n<p>Monte Carlo simulation is how you turn game probabilities into season-level questions: “What are the chances we finish top-2?” “How often do we make playoffs?” “What is the distribution of wins?”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.1 Build a future schedule</h3>\n<pre># Create a \"future\" schedule (e.g., the next 60 games)\nn_future &lt;- 60\nfuture &lt;- tibble(\n  date = seq.Date(as.Date(\"2026-02-01\"), by = \"day\", length.out = n_future),\n  home = sample(teams, n_future, replace = TRUE),\n  away = sample(teams, n_future, replace = TRUE)\n) %&gt;%\n  filter(home != away) %&gt;%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %&gt;% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %&gt;% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250)\n  )\n\nfuture %&gt;% slice(1:8)</pre>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.2 Simulate the remaining season many times</h3>\n<pre>simulate_season &lt;- function(future_games, n_sims = 5000) {\n\n  # We'll simulate all games n_sims times, then compute win totals.\n  sims &lt;- replicate(n_sims, {\n    future_games %&gt;%\n      mutate(home_win = rbinom(n(), 1, p_home)) %&gt;%\n      transmute(\n        home, away,\n        home_w = home_win,\n        away_w = 1 - home_win\n      ) %&gt;%\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(home, away), names_to = \"side\", values_to = \"team\") %&gt;%\n      mutate(win = if_else(side == \"home\", home_w, away_w)) %&gt;%\n      group_by(team) %&gt;%\n      summarize(wins = sum(win), .groups = \"drop\")\n  }, simplify = FALSE)\n\n  bind_rows(sims, .id = \"sim\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(sim = as.integer(sim))\n}\n\nseason_sims &lt;- simulate_season(future, n_sims = 3000)\n\n# Win distribution by team\nwin_dist &lt;- season_sims %&gt;%\n  group_by(team) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    avg_wins = mean(wins),\n    p_top2 = mean(rank(-wins, ties.method = \"random\") &lt;= 2),\n    p_top3 = mean(rank(-wins, ties.method = \"random\") &lt;= 3),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_wins))\n\nwin_dist</pre>\n<p><strong>Interpretation tip:</strong> simulation answers “distribution” questions (ranges, tails, chances). That’s exactly what decision-makers care about.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7) “What-if” analysis: injuries, transfers, roster changes</h2>\n<p>Counterfactuals are where modeling becomes practical: you modify team strength assumptions and see how outcomes shift. For Elo-based pipelines, this is as easy as adding/subtracting rating points.</p>\n<pre># Example: star injury reduces Lions by 60 Elo points for the rest of the season\nadjusted_ratings &lt;- elo_ratings %&gt;%\n  mutate(elo_adj = if_else(team == \"Lions\", elo - 60, elo))\n\nfuture_counterfactual &lt;- future %&gt;%\n  select(date, home, away) %&gt;%\n  left_join(adjusted_ratings %&gt;% select(team, home_elo = elo_adj), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  left_join(adjusted_ratings %&gt;% select(team, away_elo = elo_adj), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250)\n  )\n\nbaseline &lt;- simulate_season(future, n_sims = 2000) %&gt;% mutate(scenario = \"baseline\")\ninjury   &lt;- simulate_season(future_counterfactual, n_sims = 2000) %&gt;% mutate(scenario = \"lions_injury\")\n\ncompare &lt;- bind_rows(baseline, injury) %&gt;%\n  group_by(scenario, team) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_wins = mean(wins), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = scenario, values_from = avg_wins) %&gt;%\n  mutate(delta = lions_injury - baseline) %&gt;%\n  arrange(delta)\n\ncompare</pre>\n<p>The same idea works for transfers, coaching changes, or “rest days”—anything you can reasonably encode as a strength shift.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8) Poisson models for scorelines</h2>\n<p>When you predict scores (not just win/loss), Poisson models are a strong baseline—especially in low-scoring sports. The classic setup models goals scored as Poisson with attack/defense effects and home advantage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8.1 Generate toy score data</h3>\n<pre># Create toy goals (home_goals, away_goals) driven by hidden strengths.\n# This mimics soccer/hockey-like scoring.\n\nscores &lt;- matches %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    lambda_home = exp(-0.2 + 1.2*home_strength - 0.9*away_strength + 0.25),\n    lambda_away = exp(-0.2 + 1.2*away_strength - 0.9*home_strength),\n    home_goals = rpois(n(), lambda_home),\n    away_goals = rpois(n(), lambda_away),\n    home_win = as.integer(home_goals &gt; away_goals),\n    draw = as.integer(home_goals == away_goals)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(date, home, away, home_goals, away_goals, home_win, draw)\n\nscores %&gt;% slice(1:8)</pre>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8.2 Fit Poisson GLMs</h3>\n<pre># Two-model approach: predict home_goals and away_goals separately.\n# Features: team identifiers (as factors) can capture attack/defense proxies in simple form.\n\npo_home &lt;- glm(home_goals ~ home + away, data = scores, family = poisson())\npo_away &lt;- glm(away_goals ~ home + away, data = scores, family = poisson())\n\n# Predict expected goals for upcoming games\nfuture_xg &lt;- future %&gt;%\n  select(date, home, away) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    xg_home = predict(po_home, newdata = ., type = \"response\"),\n    xg_away = predict(po_away, newdata = ., type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nfuture_xg %&gt;% slice(1:8)</pre>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8.3 Convert expected goals into win probabilities</h3>\n<pre># Approximate match outcome probabilities by simulating scorelines from the Poisson rates.\nscoreline_probs &lt;- function(lambda_home, lambda_away, n = 20000) {\n  hg &lt;- rpois(n, lambda_home)\n  ag &lt;- rpois(n, lambda_away)\n  tibble(\n    p_home_win = mean(hg &gt; ag),\n    p_draw     = mean(hg == ag),\n    p_away_win = mean(hg &lt; ag)\n  )\n}\n\nexample_probs &lt;- scoreline_probs(future_xg$xg_home[1], future_xg$xg_away[1], n = 30000)\nexample_probs</pre>\n<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> if you can forecast scoring rates, you can forecast any downstream event: win, draw, total goals, both-teams-to-score, etc.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9) Logistic regression for match outcomes</h2>\n<p>A clean upgrade from “raw Elo mapping” is to fit a logistic regression that learns how rating differences translate to win probability—optionally adding context features (rest, travel, injuries, lineup quality).</p>\n<pre># Train on historical matches: outcome ~ elo_diff\ntrain &lt;- matches_w_elo %&gt;% drop_na(home_elo, away_elo)\n\nlogit &lt;- glm(home_win ~ elo_diff, data = train, family = binomial())\nsummary(logit)\n\n# Predict probabilities for future games using the fitted mapping\nfuture_logit &lt;- future %&gt;%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %&gt;% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  left_join(elo_ratings %&gt;% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = predict(logit, newdata = ., type = \"response\")\n  )\n\nfuture_logit %&gt;% slice(1:8)</pre>\n<p>Logistic regression also makes it easy to incorporate additional predictors beyond ratings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10) Using NFLSimulatoR as a simulator backbone</h2>\n<p>If you’re working on American football specifically, a purpose-built simulator can accelerate your pipeline: schedule generation, game simulation, season simulation, and standings logic.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The exact function names can differ depending on the NFLSimulatoR version you have. The pattern below shows a practical structure you can adapt: prepare team strengths → simulate games → aggregate standings → repeat.</p>\n<pre># library(NFLSimulatoR)\n\n# 1) Define (or estimate) team strength inputs\nteam_strengths &lt;- elo_ratings %&gt;% select(team, elo)\n\n# 2) Build or import a schedule (week, home, away)\n# nfl_schedule &lt;- NFLSimulatoR::load_schedule(season = 2026)\n# or your own:\nnfl_schedule &lt;- tibble(\n  week = rep(1:10, each = 3),\n  home = sample(teams, 30, replace = TRUE),\n  away = sample(teams, 30, replace = TRUE)\n) %&gt;% filter(home != away)\n\n# 3) Map strengths to win probs (Elo-based or model-based)\nnfl_games &lt;- nfl_schedule %&gt;%\n  left_join(team_strengths %&gt;% rename(home_elo = elo), by = c(\"home\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  left_join(team_strengths %&gt;% rename(away_elo = elo), by = c(\"away\" = \"team\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    elo_diff = home_elo - away_elo,\n    p_home = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250)\n  )\n\n# 4) Simulate a season many times\nsimulate_nfl_like &lt;- function(games, n_sims = 5000) {\n  sims &lt;- replicate(n_sims, {\n    games %&gt;%\n      mutate(home_win = rbinom(n(), 1, p_home)) %&gt;%\n      transmute(home, away, home_w = home_win, away_w = 1 - home_win) %&gt;%\n      pivot_longer(cols = c(home, away), names_to = \"side\", values_to = \"team\") %&gt;%\n      mutate(win = if_else(side == \"home\", home_w, away_w)) %&gt;%\n      group_by(team) %&gt;%\n      summarize(wins = sum(win), .groups = \"drop\")\n  }, simplify = FALSE)\n\n  bind_rows(sims, .id = \"sim\") %&gt;%\n    mutate(sim = as.integer(sim))\n}\n\nnfl_sims &lt;- simulate_nfl_like(nfl_games, n_sims = 3000)\n\nnfl_summary &lt;- nfl_sims %&gt;%\n  group_by(team) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    avg_wins = mean(wins),\n    p_10plus = mean(wins &gt;= 10),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(avg_wins))\n\nnfl_summary</pre>\n<p><strong>Key idea:</strong> you don’t need a “perfect” game model to get useful season-level probabilities. A reasonable win-probability engine + Monte Carlo is already powerful.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11) Evaluation: calibration + proper scoring</h2>\n<p>In prediction, accuracy alone is not enough. You want probabilities that are well-calibrated and score well under proper scoring rules (Brier score, log loss).</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11.1 Brier score</h3>\n<pre>brier_score &lt;- function(y, p) mean((y - p)^2)\n\n# Compare Elo mapping vs logistic regression mapping (on the same historical set)\neval_tbl &lt;- train %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    p_elo   = elo_prob(elo_diff, scale = 250),\n    p_logit = predict(logit, newdata = ., type = \"response\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    brier_elo = brier_score(home_win, p_elo),\n    brier_logit = brier_score(home_win, p_logit)\n  )\n\neval_tbl</pre>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11.2 Calibration table (quick check)</h3>\n<pre>calibration_table &lt;- function(y, p, bins = 10) {\n  tibble(y = y, p = p) %&gt;%\n    mutate(bin = ntile(p, bins)) %&gt;%\n    group_by(bin) %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n      p_avg = mean(p),\n      y_avg = mean(y),\n      n = n(),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n}\n\ncalib &lt;- train %&gt;%\n  mutate(p_logit = predict(logit, newdata = ., type = \"response\")) %&gt;%\n  calibration_table(y = home_win, p = p_logit, bins = 10)\n\ncalib</pre>\n<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> In each probability bin, the average predicted probability should roughly match the observed win rate.
