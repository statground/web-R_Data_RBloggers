(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nFactorial experiments are very common in agriculture and they are usually laid down to test for the significance of interactions between experimental factors. For example, genotype assessments may be performed at two different nitrogen fertilisation levels (e.g. high and low) to understand whether the ranking of genotypes depends on nutrient availability. For those of you who are not very much into agriculture, I will only say that such an assessment is relevant, because we need to know whether we can recommend the same genotypes, e.g., both in conventional agriculture (high nitrogen availability) and in organic agriculture (relatively lower nitrogen availability).\nLet’s consider an experiment where we have tested three genotypes (let’s call them A, B and C, for brevity), at two nitrogen rates (‘high’ an ‘low’) in a complete block factorial design, with four replicates. Biomass subsamples were taken from each of the 24 plots in eight different times (Days After Sowing: DAS), to evaluate the growth of biomass over time.\nThe dataset is available on ‘statforbiology’, which is the accompanying package for this blog and it is available on CRAN. It is composed by the following variables:\n‘Id’: a numerical code for observations\n‘DAS’: i.e., Days After Sowing. It is the moment when the sample was collected\n‘Block’, ‘Plot’, ‘GEN’ and ‘N’ represent respectively the block, plot, genotype and nitrogen level for each observation\n‘Yield’ represents the harvested biomass.\nFor this post, we will use several other packages, which are indicated at the beginning of the following code box; next, the dataset is loaded and the ‘Block’, ‘N’ and ‘GEN’ variables are transformed into factors.\nrm(list=ls())\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(statforbiology)\n\ndataset <- getAgroData(\"growthNGEN\")\ndataset$Block <- factor(dataset$Block)\ndataset$N <- factor(dataset$N)\ndataset$GEN <- factor(dataset$GEN)\nhead(dataset)\n##   Id DAS Block Plot GEN   N  Yield\n## 1  1   0     1    1   A Low  2.786\n## 2  2  15     1    1   A Low  5.871\n## 3  3  30     1    1   A Low 13.265\n## 4  4  45     1    1   A Low 16.926\n## 5  5  60     1    1   A Low 22.812\n## 6  6  75     1    1   A Low 25.346\nTo start the analyses, it may be useful to take a look at the observed growth data, as displayed on the graph below.\nWe see that the growth is sygmoidal (presumably logistic) and that the variance of observations increases over time, i.e. the variance is proportional to the expected response.\nThe question is: how do we analyse this data? Let’s build a model in a sequential fashion.\nThe model\nWe could empirically assume that the relationship between biomass and time is logistic:\n\\[ Y_{ijkl} = \\frac{d_{ijkl}}{1 + exp\\left[b \\left( X_{ijkl} - e_{ijkl}\\right)\\right]} + \\varepsilon_{ijkl}\\quad \\quad (1)\\]\nwhere\n\\(Y\\)\nis the observed biomass yield at time\n\\(X\\)\n, for the i-th genotype, j-th nitrogen level, k-th block and l-th plot,\n\\(d\\)\nis the maximum asymptotic biomass level when time goes to infinity,\n\\(b\\)\nis the slope at inflection point, while\n\\(e\\)\nis the time when the biomass yield is equal to\n\\(d/2\\)\n. We are mostly interested in the parameters\n\\(d\\)\nand\n\\(e\\)\n: the first one describes the yield potential of a genotype, while the second one gives a measure of the speed of growth.\nThere are repeated measures in each plot and, therefore, model parameters may show some variability, depending on the genotype, nitrogen level, block and plot. In particular, it may be acceptable to assume that\n\\(b\\)\nis pretty constant and independent on the above factors, while\n\\(d\\)\nand\n\\(e\\)\nmay change according to the following equations:\n\\[\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}\nd_{ijkl} = \\mu_d + g_{di} + N_{dj} + gN_{dij} + \\theta_{dk} + \\zeta_{dl}\\\\\ne_{ijkl} = \\mu_e + q_{ei} + N_{ej} + gN_{eij} + \\theta_{ek} + \\zeta_{el}\n\\end{array}} \\right. \\quad \\quad (2) \\]\nwhere, for each parameter,\n\\(\\mu\\)\nis the intercept,\n\\(g\\)\nis the fixed effect of the i-th genotype,\n\\(N\\)\nis the fixed effect of j-th nitrogen level,\n\\(gN\\)\nis the fixed interaction effect,\n\\(\\theta\\)\nis the random effect of blocks, while\n\\(\\zeta\\)\nis the random effect of plots within blocks. These two equations are totally equivalent to those commonly used for linear mixed models, in the case of a two-factor factorial block design, wherein\n\\(\\zeta\\)\nwould be the residual error term. Indeed, in principle, we could also think about a two-steps fitting procedure, where we:\nfit the logistic model to the data for each plot and obtain estimates for\n\\(d\\)\nand\n\\(e\\)\nuse these estimates to fit a linear mixed model\nWe will not pursue this two-steps technique here and we will concentrate on one-step fitting.\nA wrong method\nIf the observations were independent (i.e. no blocks and no repeated measures), this model could be fit by using conventional nonlinear regression. My preference goes to the\ndrm()\nfunction in the ‘drc’ package (Ritz et al., 2015).\nThe coding is reported below: ‘Yield’ is a function of (\n\\(\\sim\\)\n) DAS, by way of a three-parameters logistic function (‘fct = L.3()’). Different curves have to be fitted for different combinations of genotype and nitrogen levels (‘curveid = N:GEN’), although these curves should be partly based on common parameter values (’pmodels = …).\nThe ‘pmodels’ argument requires a few additional comments. It must be a vector with as many element as there are parameters in the model (three, in this case:\n\\(b\\)\n,\n\\(d\\)\nand\n\\(e\\)\n). Each element represents a linear function of variables and refers to the parameters in alphabetical order, i.e. the first element refers to\n\\(b\\)\n, the second refers to\n\\(d\\)\nand the third to\n\\(e\\)\n. The parameter\n\\(b\\)\nis not dependent on any variable (‘~ 1’) and thus a constant value is fitted across curves;\n\\(d\\)\nand\n\\(e\\)\ndepend on a fully factorial combination of genotype and nitrogen level (~ N*GEN = ~N + GEN + N:GEN). Finally, we used the argument ‘bcVal = 0.5’ to specify that we intend to use a Transform-Both-Sides technique, where a logarithmic transformation is performed for both sides of the equations. This is necessary to account for heteroscedasticity, but it does not affect the scale of parameter estimates.\nmodNaive1 <- drm(Yield ~ DAS, fct = L.3(), data = dataset,\n            curveid = GEN:N,\n            pmodels = c( ~ 1,  ~ N*GEN,  ~ N*GEN), bcVal = 0.5)\nThis model may be useful for other circumstances (no blocks and no repeated measures), but it is wrong in our example. Indeed, observations are clustered within blocks and plots; by neglecting this, we violate the assumption of independence of model residuals. Swift plots of residuals against fitted values and QQ-plot show that there are no problems with heteroscedasticity and normality, although a few outliers might deserve careful inspection (which we will neglect now). Note that these two graphs are obtained using the\nplotRes()\nfunction in ‘statforbiology’.\nConsidering the above, we have to use a different model, here, although I will show that this naive fit may turn out useful.\nNonlinear mixed model fitting\nIn order to account for the clustering of observations, we switch to a Nonlinear Mixed-Effect model (NLME). A good choice is the\nnlme()\nfunction in the ‘nlme’ package (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000), although the syntax may be cumbersome, at times. I will try to help, listing and commenting the most important arguments for this function. We need to specify the following:\nA deterministic function. In this case, we use the\nNLS.L3()\nfunction in the ‘statforbiology’ package, which provides a logistic growth model with the same parameterisation as the\nL.3()\nfunction in the ‘drc’ package.\nLinear functions for model parameters. The ‘fixed’ argument in the ‘nlme’ function is very similar to the ‘pmodels’ argument in the ‘drm’ function above, in the sense that it requires a list, wherein each element is a linear function of variables. The only difference is that the parameter name needs to be specified on the left side of the function.\nRandom effects for model parameters. These are specified by using the ‘random’ argument. In this case, the parameters\n\\(d\\)\nand\n\\(e\\)\nare expected to show random variability from block to block and from plot to plot, within a block. For the sake of simplicity, as the parameter\n\\(b\\)\nis not affected by the genotype and nitrogen level, we also expect that it does not show any random variability across blocks and plots.\nStarting values for model parameters. Self starting routines are not used by\nnlme()\nand thus we need to specify a named vector, holding the initial values of model parameters. In this case, I decided to use the output from the ‘naive’ nonlinear regression above, which, therefore, turns out useful.\nThe transformation of both sides of the equation is made explicitely.\nmodnlme1 <- nlme(sqrt(Yield) ~ sqrt(NLS.L3(DAS, b, d, e)), \n                 data = dataset,\n                    random = d + e ~ 1|Block/Plot,\n                    fixed = list(b ~ 1, d ~ N*GEN, e ~ N*GEN),\n                    start = coef(modNaive1), \n                 control = list(msMaxIter = 400))\nsummary(modnlme1)$tTable\n##                     Value   Std.Error  DF    t-value      p-value\n## b              0.05652837 0.002157629 228 26.1993018 1.044743e-70\n## d.(Intercept) 33.91575348 1.222612866 228 27.7403865 5.073982e-75\n## d.NLow        -3.18382830 1.592502935 228 -1.9992606 4.676721e-02\n## d.GENB        18.90014651 1.864712716 228 10.1356881 3.602004e-20\n## d.GENC        -1.15934033 1.686405282 228 -0.6874625 4.924901e-01\n## d.NLow:GENB   -5.99216682 2.455759119 228 -2.4400467 1.544863e-02\n## d.NLow:GENC   -5.82864845 2.217534809 228 -2.6284361 9.160826e-03\n## e.(Intercept) 55.20071252 2.320784607 228 23.7853665 1.087153e-63\n## e.NLow        -9.06217426 3.127165879 228 -2.8978873 4.123120e-03\n## e.GENB        -4.47038042 2.761533544 228 -1.6188036 1.068720e-01\n## e.GENC         4.00746125 3.084383627 228  1.2992746 1.951620e-01\n## e.NLow:GENB   -4.71367457 4.055953633 228 -1.1621618 2.463848e-01\n## e.NLow:GENC    2.23951067 4.609547644 228  0.4858417 6.275460e-01\nFrom the plots above, we see that the overall fit is good.

Indeed, we have two available tests: on for the parameter\n\\(d\\)\nand one for the parameter\n\\(e\\)\n. First of all, we code two ‘reduced’ models, where the genotype and nitrogen effects are purely addictive. To do so, we change the specification of the fixed effects from ’~ N*GEN’ to ‘~ N + GEN’. Also in this case, we use a ‘naive’ nonlinear regression fit to get starting values for model parameters, to be used in the following NLME model fitting.\nmodNaive2 <- drm(Yield ~ DAS, fct = L.3(), \n                 data = dataset,\n                 curveid = N:GEN,\n                 pmodels = c( ~ 1,  ~ N + GEN,  ~ N * GEN), \n                 bcVal = 0.5)\n\nmodnlme2 <- nlme(sqrt(Yield) ~ sqrt(NLS.L3(DAS, b, d, e)), \n                 data = dataset,\n                 random = d + e ~ 1|Block/Plot,\n                 fixed = list(b ~ 1, d ~ N + GEN, e ~ N*GEN),\n                 start = coef(modNaive2), \n                 control = list(msMaxIter = 200))\n\nmodNaive3 <- drm(Yield ~ DAS, fct = L.3(), data = dataset,\n            curveid = N:GEN,\n            pmodels = c( ~ 1,  ~ N*GEN,  ~ N + GEN), bcVal = 0.5)\n\nmodnlme3 <- nlme(sqrt(Yield) ~ sqrt(NLS.L3(DAS, b, d, e)),\n                 data = dataset,\n                 random = d + e ~ 1|Block/Plot,\n                 fixed = list(b ~ 1, d ~ N*GEN, e ~ N + GEN),\n                 start = coef(modNaive3), control = list(msMaxIter = 200))\nLet’s consider the first reduced model ‘modnlme2’. In this model, the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction has been removed for the\n\\(d\\)\nparameter. We can compare this reduced model with the full model ‘modnlme1’, by using a Likelihood Ratio Test:\nanova(modnlme1, modnlme2)\n##          Model df      AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\n## modnlme1     1 20 329.1496 400.6686 -144.5748                        \n## modnlme2     2 18 334.2187 398.5857 -149.1093 1 vs 2 9.069075  0.0107\nThis test is significant, but the AIC value is very close for the two models. Considering that a LRT in mixed models is usually rather liberal, it should be possible to conclude that the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction is not significant and, therefore, the ranking of genotypes in terms of yield potential, as measured by the\n\\(d\\)\nparameter should be independent on nitrogen level.\nLet’s now consider the second reduced model ‘modnlme3’. In this second model, the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction has been removed for the ‘e’ parameter. We can compare also this reduced model with the full model ‘modnlme1’, by using a Likelihood Ratio Test:\nanova(modnlme1, modnlme3)\n##          Model df      AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\n## modnlme1     1 20 329.1496 400.6686 -144.5748                        \n## modnlme3     2 18 328.2446 392.6117 -146.1223 1 vs 2 3.095068  0.2128\nIn this second test, the lack of significance for the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction seems to be less questionable than in the first one.\nI would like to conclude by drawing your attention to the ‘medrm’ function in the ‘medrc’ package, which can also be used to fit this type of nonlinear mixed-effects models.\nHappy coding with R! … and … don’t forget to check out my new book!\nProf. Andrea Onofri\nDepartment of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Sciences\nUniversity of Perugia (Italy)\nSend comments to:\n[email protected]\nReferences\nPinheiro, J.C., Bates, D.M., 2000.

Biomass subsamples were taken from each of the 24 plots in eight different times (Days After Sowing: DAS), to evaluate the growth of biomass over time.</p>\n<p>The dataset is available on ‘statforbiology’, which is the accompanying package for this blog and it is available on CRAN. It is composed by the following variables:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>‘Id’: a numerical code for observations</li>\n<li>‘DAS’: i.e., Days After Sowing. It is the moment when the sample was collected</li>\n<li>‘Block’, ‘Plot’, ‘GEN’ and ‘N’ represent respectively the block, plot, genotype and nitrogen level for each observation</li>\n<li>‘Yield’ represents the harvested biomass.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For this post, we will use several other packages, which are indicated at the beginning of the following code box; next, the dataset is loaded and the ‘Block’, ‘N’ and ‘GEN’ variables are transformed into factors.</p>\n<pre>rm(list=ls())\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(statforbiology)\n\ndataset &lt;- getAgroData(\"growthNGEN\")\ndataset$Block &lt;- factor(dataset$Block)\ndataset$N &lt;- factor(dataset$N)\ndataset$GEN &lt;- factor(dataset$GEN)\nhead(dataset)\n##   Id DAS Block Plot GEN   N  Yield\n## 1  1   0     1    1   A Low  2.786\n## 2  2  15     1    1   A Low  5.871\n## 3  3  30     1    1   A Low 13.265\n## 4  4  45     1    1   A Low 16.926\n## 5  5  60     1    1   A Low 22.812\n## 6  6  75     1    1   A Low 25.346</pre>\n<p>To start the analyses, it may be useful to take a look at the observed growth data, as displayed on the graph below.</p>\n<p><img data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>We see that the growth is sygmoidal (presumably logistic) and that the variance of observations increases over time, i.e. the variance is proportional to the expected response.</p>\n<p>The question is: how do we analyse this data? Let’s build a model in a sequential fashion.</p>\n<div class=\"section level1\" id=\"the-model\">\n<h1>The model</h1>\n<p>We could empirically assume that the relationship between biomass and time is logistic:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math display\">\\[ Y_{ijkl} = \\frac{d_{ijkl}}{1 + exp\\left[b \\left( X_{ijkl} - e_{ijkl}\\right)\\right]} + \\varepsilon_{ijkl}\\quad \\quad (1)\\]</span></p>\n<p>where <span class=\"math inline\">\\(Y\\)</span> is the observed biomass yield at time <span class=\"math inline\">\\(X\\)</span>, for the i-th genotype, j-th nitrogen level, k-th block and l-th plot, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> is the maximum asymptotic biomass level when time goes to infinity, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(b\\)</span> is the slope at inflection point, while <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span> is the time when the biomass yield is equal to <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d/2\\)</span>. We are mostly interested in the parameters <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span>: the first one describes the yield potential of a genotype, while the second one gives a measure of the speed of growth.</p>\n<p>There are repeated measures in each plot and, therefore, model parameters may show some variability, depending on the genotype, nitrogen level, block and plot. In particular, it may be acceptable to assume that <span class=\"math inline\">\\(b\\)</span> is pretty constant and independent on the above factors, while <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span> may change according to the following equations:</p>\n<p><span class=\"math display\">\\[\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}\nd_{ijkl} = \\mu_d + g_{di} + N_{dj} + gN_{dij} + \\theta_{dk} + \\zeta_{dl}\\\\\ne_{ijkl} = \\mu_e + q_{ei} + N_{ej} + gN_{eij} + \\theta_{ek} + \\zeta_{el}\n\\end{array}} \\right. \\quad \\quad (2) \\]</span></p>\n<p>where, for each parameter, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\mu\\)</span> is the intercept, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(g\\)</span> is the fixed effect of the i-th genotype, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(N\\)</span> is the fixed effect of j-th nitrogen level, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(gN\\)</span> is the fixed interaction effect, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\theta\\)</span> is the random effect of blocks, while <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\zeta\\)</span> is the random effect of plots within blocks. These two equations are totally equivalent to those commonly used for linear mixed models, in the case of a two-factor factorial block design, wherein <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\zeta\\)</span> would be the residual error term. Indeed, in principle, we could also think about a two-steps fitting procedure, where we:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>fit the logistic model to the data for each plot and obtain estimates for <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span></li>\n<li>use these estimates to fit a linear mixed model</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will not pursue this two-steps technique here and we will concentrate on one-step fitting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section level1\" id=\"a-wrong-method\">\n<h1>A wrong method</h1>\n<p>If the observations were independent (i.e. no blocks and no repeated measures), this model could be fit by using conventional nonlinear regression. My preference goes to the <code>drm()</code> function in the ‘drc’ package (Ritz et al., 2015).</p>\n<p>The coding is reported below: ‘Yield’ is a function of (<span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\sim\\)</span>) DAS, by way of a three-parameters logistic function (‘fct = L.3()’). Different curves have to be fitted for different combinations of genotype and nitrogen levels (‘curveid = N:GEN’), although these curves should be partly based on common parameter values (’pmodels = …).</p>\n<p>The ‘pmodels’ argument requires a few additional comments. It must be a vector with as many element as there are parameters in the model (three, in this case: <span class=\"math inline\">\\(b\\)</span>, <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span>). Each element represents a linear function of variables and refers to the parameters in alphabetical order, i.e. the first element refers to <span class=\"math inline\">\\(b\\)</span>, the second refers to <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and the third to <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span>. The parameter <span class=\"math inline\">\\(b\\)</span> is not dependent on any variable (‘~ 1’) and thus a constant value is fitted across curves; <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span> depend on a fully factorial combination of genotype and nitrogen level (~ N*GEN = ~N + GEN + N:GEN). Finally, we used the argument ‘bcVal = 0.5’ to specify that we intend to use a Transform-Both-Sides technique, where a logarithmic transformation is performed for both sides of the equations. This is necessary to account for heteroscedasticity, but it does not affect the scale of parameter estimates.</p>\n<pre>modNaive1 &lt;- drm(Yield ~ DAS, fct = L.3(), data = dataset,\n            curveid = GEN:N,\n            pmodels = c( ~ 1,  ~ N*GEN,  ~ N*GEN), bcVal = 0.5)</pre>\n<p>This model may be useful for other circumstances (no blocks and no repeated measures), but it is wrong in our example. Indeed, observations are clustered within blocks and plots; by neglecting this, we violate the assumption of independence of model residuals. Swift plots of residuals against fitted values and QQ-plot show that there are no problems with heteroscedasticity and normality, although a few outliers might deserve careful inspection (which we will neglect now). Note that these two graphs are obtained using the <code>plotRes()</code> function in ‘statforbiology’.</p>\n<p><img data-lazy-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png?w=90%25&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"/><noscript><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png?w=90%25&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>Considering the above, we have to use a different model, here, although I will show that this naive fit may turn out useful.</p>\n<div class=\"section level2\" id=\"nonlinear-mixed-model-fitting\">\n<h2>Nonlinear mixed model fitting</h2>\n<p>In order to account for the clustering of observations, we switch to a Nonlinear Mixed-Effect model (NLME). A good choice is the <code>nlme()</code> function in the ‘nlme’ package (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000), although the syntax may be cumbersome, at times. I will try to help, listing and commenting the most important arguments for this function. We need to specify the following:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>A deterministic function. In this case, we use the <code>NLS.L3()</code> function in the ‘statforbiology’ package, which provides a logistic growth model with the same parameterisation as the <code>L.3()</code> function in the ‘drc’ package.</li>\n<li>Linear functions for model parameters. The ‘fixed’ argument in the ‘nlme’ function is very similar to the ‘pmodels’ argument in the ‘drm’ function above, in the sense that it requires a list, wherein each element is a linear function of variables. The only difference is that the parameter name needs to be specified on the left side of the function.</li>\n<li>Random effects for model parameters. These are specified by using the ‘random’ argument. In this case, the parameters <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span> are expected to show random variability from block to block and from plot to plot, within a block. For the sake of simplicity, as the parameter <span class=\"math inline\">\\(b\\)</span> is not affected by the genotype and nitrogen level, we also expect that it does not show any random variability across blocks and plots.</li>\n<li>Starting values for model parameters. Self starting routines are not used by <code>nlme()</code> and thus we need to specify a named vector, holding the initial values of model parameters. In this case, I decided to use the output from the ‘naive’ nonlinear regression above, which, therefore, turns out useful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The transformation of both sides of the equation is made explicitely.</p>\n<pre>modnlme1 &lt;- nlme(sqrt(Yield) ~ sqrt(NLS.L3(DAS, b, d, e)), \n                 data = dataset,\n                    random = d + e ~ 1|Block/Plot,\n                    fixed = list(b ~ 1, d ~ N*GEN, e ~ N*GEN),\n                    start = coef(modNaive1), \n                 control = list(msMaxIter = 400))\nsummary(modnlme1)$tTable\n##                     Value   Std.Error  DF    t-value      p-value\n## b              0.05652837 0.002157629 228 26.1993018 1.044743e-70\n## d.(Intercept) 33.91575348 1.222612866 228 27.7403865 5.073982e-75\n## d.NLow        -3.18382830 1.592502935 228 -1.9992606 4.676721e-02\n## d.GENB        18.90014651 1.864712716 228 10.1356881 3.602004e-20\n## d.GENC        -1.15934033 1.686405282 228 -0.6874625 4.924901e-01\n## d.NLow:GENB   -5.99216682 2.455759119 228 -2.4400467 1.544863e-02\n## d.NLow:GENC   -5.82864845 2.217534809 228 -2.6284361 9.160826e-03\n## e.(Intercept) 55.20071252 2.320784607 228 23.7853665 1.087153e-63\n## e.NLow        -9.06217426 3.127165879 228 -2.8978873 4.123120e-03\n## e.GENB        -4.47038042 2.761533544 228 -1.6188036 1.068720e-01\n## e.GENC         4.00746125 3.084383627 228  1.2992746 1.951620e-01\n## e.NLow:GENB   -4.71367457 4.055953633 228 -1.1621618 2.463848e-01\n## e.NLow:GENC    2.23951067 4.609547644 228  0.4858417 6.275460e-01</pre>\n<p><img data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=90%25&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"/><noscript><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=90%25&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"/></noscript></p>\n<p><img data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png?w=90%25&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"/><noscript><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/post/Stat_nlmm_Interaction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png?w=90%25&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>From the plots above, we see that the overall fit is good.

Indeed, we have two available tests: on for the parameter <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> and one for the parameter <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e\\)</span>. First of all, we code two ‘reduced’ models, where the genotype and nitrogen effects are purely addictive. To do so, we change the specification of the fixed effects from ’~ N*GEN’ to ‘~ N + GEN’. Also in this case, we use a ‘naive’ nonlinear regression fit to get starting values for model parameters, to be used in the following NLME model fitting.</p>\n<pre>modNaive2 &lt;- drm(Yield ~ DAS, fct = L.3(), \n                 data = dataset,\n                 curveid = N:GEN,\n                 pmodels = c( ~ 1,  ~ N + GEN,  ~ N * GEN), \n                 bcVal = 0.5)\n\nmodnlme2 &lt;- nlme(sqrt(Yield) ~ sqrt(NLS.L3(DAS, b, d, e)), \n                 data = dataset,\n                 random = d + e ~ 1|Block/Plot,\n                 fixed = list(b ~ 1, d ~ N + GEN, e ~ N*GEN),\n                 start = coef(modNaive2), \n                 control = list(msMaxIter = 200))\n\nmodNaive3 &lt;- drm(Yield ~ DAS, fct = L.3(), data = dataset,\n            curveid = N:GEN,\n            pmodels = c( ~ 1,  ~ N*GEN,  ~ N + GEN), bcVal = 0.5)\n\nmodnlme3 &lt;- nlme(sqrt(Yield) ~ sqrt(NLS.L3(DAS, b, d, e)),\n                 data = dataset,\n                 random = d + e ~ 1|Block/Plot,\n                 fixed = list(b ~ 1, d ~ N*GEN, e ~ N + GEN),\n                 start = coef(modNaive3), control = list(msMaxIter = 200))</pre>\n<p>Let’s consider the first reduced model ‘modnlme2’. In this model, the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction has been removed for the <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> parameter. We can compare this reduced model with the full model ‘modnlme1’, by using a Likelihood Ratio Test:</p>\n<pre>anova(modnlme1, modnlme2)\n##          Model df      AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\n## modnlme1     1 20 329.1496 400.6686 -144.5748                        \n## modnlme2     2 18 334.2187 398.5857 -149.1093 1 vs 2 9.069075  0.0107</pre>\n<p>This test is significant, but the AIC value is very close for the two models. Considering that a LRT in mixed models is usually rather liberal, it should be possible to conclude that the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction is not significant and, therefore, the ranking of genotypes in terms of yield potential, as measured by the <span class=\"math inline\">\\(d\\)</span> parameter should be independent on nitrogen level.</p>\n<p>Let’s now consider the second reduced model ‘modnlme3’. In this second model, the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction has been removed for the ‘e’ parameter. We can compare also this reduced model with the full model ‘modnlme1’, by using a Likelihood Ratio Test:</p>\n<pre>anova(modnlme1, modnlme3)\n##          Model df      AIC      BIC    logLik   Test  L.Ratio p-value\n## modnlme1     1 20 329.1496 400.6686 -144.5748                        \n## modnlme3     2 18 328.2446 392.6117 -146.1223 1 vs 2 3.095068  0.2128</pre>\n<p>In this second test, the lack of significance for the ‘genotype x nitrogen’ interaction seems to be less questionable than in the first one.</p>\n<p>I would like to conclude by drawing your attention to the ‘medrm’ function in the ‘medrc’ package, which can also be used to fit this type of nonlinear mixed-effects models.</p>\n<p>Happy coding with R! … and … don’t forget to check out my new book!</p>\n<p>Prof. Andrea Onofri<br/>\nDepartment of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Sciences<br/>\nUniversity of Perugia (Italy)<br/>\nSend comments to: <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6d7d8d2c4d3d798d9d8d9d0c4dff6c3d8dfc6d198dfc2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"85e4ebe1f7e0e4abeaebeae3f7ecc5f0ebecf5e2abecf1\">[email protected]</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=26429&amp;awinaffid=2675822&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fbook%2F10.1007%2F978-3-032-08199-5\"><img align=\"center\" alt=\"Book cover\" class=\"cover\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/_Figures/Email_Signature_978-3-032-08199-5.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img align=\"center\" alt=\"Book cover\" class=\"cover\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.statforbiology.com/_Figures/Email_Signature_978-3-032-08199-5.png?w=578&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></a>\n<br/></p>\n<hr/>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section level1\" id=\"references\">\n<h1>References</h1>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>Pinheiro, J.C., Bates, D.M., 2000.
