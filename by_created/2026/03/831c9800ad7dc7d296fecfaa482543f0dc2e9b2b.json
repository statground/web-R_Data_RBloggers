(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nJoin our workshop on\nAgentic coding with R,\nwhich is a part of our workshops for Ukraine series!\nHere’s some more info:\nTitle\n:\nAgentic coding with R\nDate\n: Thursday, April 2nd, 14:00 – 16:00 CET (Rome, Berlin, Paris timezone)\nSpeaker\n: Charles Crabtree is a political scientist and Senior Lecturer in the School of Social Sciences at Monash University. His research sits at the intersection of political behavior, discrimination, and research methods, with work spanning experiments, text analysis, and large-scale observational data.\nDescription:\nThis workshop introduces\nagentic coding\nfor R: using AI assistants that can help you plan, write, run, and revise multi-step analysis workflows while keeping your work transparent and reproducible. Using Warp.dev as a concrete interface, we will walk through practical patterns for (1) turning messy research tasks into clear, checkable steps, (2) writing R code safely, (3) generating documentation and analysis notes as you work, and (4) developing a paper trail you can share with coauthors or future you. A key focus is adversarial agentic coding: pairing a “builder” agent with a separate “reviewer” agent that tries to break, audit, and improve the code the first agent produced—stress-testing assumptions, spotting silent failures, and proposing fixes. The emphasis is not on prompt tricks, but on reliable habits: how to constrain the agent, verify outputs, and integrate agentic help into real projects (data cleaning, modeling, tables and figures, and report generation). Participants will leave with copy-paste templates they can reuse immediately.\nMinimal registration fee:\n20 euro (or 20 USD or 800 UAH)\nPlease note that the registration confirmation is sent 1 day before the workshop to all registered participants rather than immediately after registration\nHow can I register?\nGo to\nhttps://bit.ly/3wvwMA6\nor\nhttps://bit.ly/4aD5LMC\nor\nhttps://bit.ly/3PFxtNA\nand donate\nat least 20 euro\n.\nFeel free to donate more if you can, all proceeds go directly to support Ukraine.\nSave your donation receipt (after the donation is processed, there is an option to enter your email address on the website to which the donation receipt is sent)\nFill in the\nregistration form\n, attaching a screenshot of a donation receipt (please attach the screenshot of the donation receipt that was emailed to you rather than the page you see after donation).\nIf you are not personally interested in attending, you can also contribute by sponsoring a participation of a student, who will then be able to participate for free. If you choose to sponsor a student, all proceeds will also go directly to organisations working in Ukraine. You can either sponsor a particular student or you can leave it up to us so that we can allocate the sponsored place to students who have signed up for the waiting list.\nHow can I sponsor a student?\nGo to\nhttps://bit.ly/3wvwMA6\nor\nhttps://bit.ly/4aD5LMC\nor\nhttps://bit.ly/3PFxtNA\nand donate\nat least 20 euro\n(or 17 GBP or 20 USD or 800 UAH).\nFeel free to donate more if you can, all proceeds go to support Ukraine!\nSave your donation receipt (after the donation is processed, there is an option to enter your email address on the website to which the donation receipt is sent)\nFill in the\nsponsorship form\n, attaching the screenshot of the donation receipt (please attach the screenshot of the donation receipt that was emailed to you rather than the page you see after the donation). You can indicate whether you want to sponsor a particular student or we can allocate this spot ourselves to the students from the waiting list. You can also indicate whether you prefer us to prioritize students from developing countries when assigning place(s) that you sponsored.\nIf you are a university student and cannot afford the registration fee, you can also sign up for the\nwaiting list\nhere\n.
