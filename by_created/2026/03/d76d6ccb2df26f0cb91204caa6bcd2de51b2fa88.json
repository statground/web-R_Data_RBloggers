    "main_text": "The Limits of AI: Why Automated Optimization (often) Fails in Smaller Markets\nPosted on\nFebruary 21, 2026\nby\nFlorian Teschner\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nFlorian Teschner\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nIn my last post, I discussed that clicks are a bad metric to optimise against in advertising systems. However, optimising against metrics that are closer to conversion do have their limits. \nBasically, if feedback to AI systems (e.g. Ad optimisation systems) is too sparse, claims to automatically optimise / personalise ads do not hold up.\nShort practical advice on ad optimization in smaller markets:\nKnow your feedback loop density\n— AI optimization systems require enough conversion events to learn. In small markets, you simply won’t have enough feedback to train reliable models.\nCalculate required impressions upfront\n— Before launching complex tests (multiple creatives, multiple audiences), run the sample size math. If the numbers don’t add up to something achievable in your timeframe, simplify the test design.\nUse higher-frequency proxies\n— When conversions are sparse, optimize for site visits, add-to-cart, or other mid-funnel events. These provide 10-100x more training signal.\nAccept that US-designed systems don’t scale down\n— Platforms built for the US market (330M+ people) assume abundant data. The same algorithms don’t work when you have 1/50th the population.\nManual beats broken automation\n— If you need 34 million impressions for statistical significance but only have capacity for 2 million, human-designed targeting will beat AI that’s still “cold start.”\nLong Version\nAI-driven ad optimization and personalization systems are impressive. TikTok, Google, Meta; they can show you the right ad to the right person at the right time, learning and improving continuously. But there’s a dirty secret:\nthese systems are built for the US/Chinese market.\nWhen you try to use them in smaller markets like Germany (80 million people) or Sweden (10 million), the math breaks down. The feedback loop that enables AI learning becomes too sparse for the algorithms to work.\nThis isn’t about AI quality — it’s about sample size. And the implications are brutal for anyone running sophisticated ad campaigns outside the world’s largest markets.\nThe fundamental constraint: events per model\nAI optimization systems learn from feedback. Every conversion (or proxy event) is a training example. The more examples, the better the model. But there’s a threshold below which learning simply doesn’t happen.\nIn the US, with 330 million people and billions of ad impressions daily, you accumulate training data rapidly. In Sweden, with 10 million people, you might get 1/30th the volume — but the AI system doesn’t need 1/30th the data. It needs roughly the\nsame\namount of data to converge.\nThe result:\nAI optimization never converges.\nIt’s perpetually in “cold start” mode, making decisions based on noise rather than signal.\nSample size reality check\nLet me work through a concrete example. Say you want to run an A/B test comparing ad creatives:\nCTR = 0.5% (typical for display ads)\nClick-to-Conversion Rate = 2% (people who click and convert)\nThis gives us an impression to Conversion Rate = 0.01%\nWe want to detect which creative is 30% better than the others\nHow many impressions do we need?\n3 creatives\nJust 3 variations of the same ad:\n# Sample size calculation for detecting 30% lift in LPEV\n# Base rate: 0.01% (CTR 0.5% x Conversion 2%)\n\nbase_rate <- 0.0001  # 0.01%\nlift_to_detect <- 0.30  # 30% improvement\nalpha <- 0.05\npower <- 0.80\n\n# For 3 arms (3 comparisons), need Bonferroni correction\n# Z for 95% confidence with 3 comparisons\nz_alpha <- qnorm(1 - (0.05 / 6))\nz_beta <- qnorm(power)\n\ndelta <- base_rate * lift_to_detect\n\n# Sample size per arm\nn_per_arm <- ((z_alpha + z_beta)^2 * 2 * base_rate * (1 - base_rate)) / (delta^2)\n\nn_per_arm\nThis gives us approximately\n2.3 million impressions per creative\n.\nTotal for 3 creatives: ~7 million impressions\n5 creatives\nTesting 5 different ads means 10 pairwise comparisons. This pushes the sample size up:\nScenario\nImpressions per arm\nTotal impressions\n3 creatives\n~2.3M\n~7M\n5 creatives\n~3.0M\n~15M\n9 arms (3 audiences × 3 creatives)\n~3.8M\n~34M\nPersonalisation of Ads: The 9-arm problem\nNow imagine testing 3 different audience segments with 3 creatives each — 9 total variations. You need\n34 million impressions\nfor statistical significance.\nR simulation: Sample size by arm count\nLet me visualize how sample size grows with complexity:\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n# Parameters\nbase_rate <- 0.0001  # 0.01% LPEV\nlift <- 0.30  # 30% improvement to detect\n\n# Sample sizes for different numbers of arms\narms <- c(2, 3, 5, 9, 15)\ncomparisons <- sapply(arms, function(n) n choose 2)  # Pairwise comparisons\nalpha_adjusted <- 0.05 / comparisons\n\n# Z-scores for each scenario\nz_alpha <- qnorm(1 - alpha_adjusted / 2)\nz_beta <- qnorm(0.80)\n\ndelta <- base_rate * lift\n\nsample_per_arm <- ((z_alpha + z_beta)^2 * 2 * base_rate * (1 - base_rate)) / (delta^2)\ntotal_impressions <- sample_per_arm * arms\n\ndf_sample <- data.frame(\n  arms = factor(arms),\n  per_arm = round(sample_per_arm / 1e6, 1),\n  total = round(total_impressions / 1e6, 1)\n)\n\nggplot(df_sample, aes(x = arms, y = total, fill = arms)) +\n  geom_col(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(total, \"M\")),\n            vjust = -0.5, size = 4, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(\"Total impressions (millions)\",\n                    labels = comma_format(),\n                    limits = c(0, 45)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  labs(title = \"Sample Size Explodes with Test Complexity\",\n       subtitle = \"Detecting 30% lift at 0.01% conversion rate\",\n       caption = \"US-scale campaigns can hit these numbers; smaller markets never will\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\nThe key insight: sample size grows\nsuper-linearly\nwith the number of arms. 9 arms require nearly 5x the impressions of 2 arms.\nThe market size problem\nNow let’s compare market sizes:\nMarket\nPopulation\nDaily ad impressions\nTime to 34M impressions\nUS\n330M\n~5M\n~7 weeks\nGermany\n80M\n~0.5M\n~68 weeks\nSweden\n10M\n~0.1M\n~85 weeks\nIn the US, a 9-arm test converges in a couple of weeks. In Sweden, the same test takes almost\ntwo years\n;  by which time the market has changed, the creatives are stale, and the test results are meaningless.\nThe per capita problem\nIt’s not just about total market size. It’s about\nper capita conversion events\n.\nAI systems don’t learn from total population — they learn from events per user. If your population is 1/30th the size, and your spend scales proportionally, you get 1/30th the events. But the AI system needs the\nsame\nnumber of events to reach the same level of sophistication.\nWhat actually happens in practice\nWhen you deploy US-designed AI optimization in smaller markets, here’s what occurs:\nThe system never leaves cold start\n: It’s perpetually uncertain, changing targets randomly based on noise.\nOversimplification occurs\n: To get\nany\nsignal, the system lumps users into broad segments. “Personalization” becomes barely better than random.\nWrong optimizations\n: When the system does make a decision (e.g., Creative A beats Creative B), it’s often statistically invalid. The “winner” won by random chance, not actual performance.\nFeedback loop damage\n: Bad early decisions reinforce themselves. The system optimizes toward the wrong target, creating a local optimum that’s hard to escape.\nSolutions for smaller markets\nIf you’re running sophisticated ad campaigns outside the US, what can you do?\n1. Simplify test design\nDon’t run 9-arm tests. Run 2-arm tests (A/B), or even single-variant campaigns with clear hypotheses. The math becomes tractable:\n2 arms: ~2 million impressions\n3 arms: ~7 million impressions\n9 arms: ~34 million impressions\n2. Use higher-frequency proxies\nInstead of optimizing for purchases (0.01% rate), optimize for:\nSite visits (1-2% rate) — 100-200x more events\nAdd-to-cart (0.5-1% rate) — 50-100x more events\nPage engagement metrics (0.5-2% rate) — varies by page\nThis is exactly what Dalessandro et al.’s paper recommends (see last post). A proxy with 1% rate needs ~100x fewer impressions than one with 0.01% rate.\n3. Pool across markets\nIf you operate in multiple smaller markets, consider:\nTraining on pooled data, applying locally (with geographic controls)\nRunning pan-European tests when individual country tests aren’t feasible\nUsing global models with regional fine-tuning\n4. Accept manual beats broken automation\nSometimes the best “AI” is a human who understands:\nYour specific market dynamics\nSeasonal patterns unique to your region\nCreative and messaging that resonates locally\nAn experienced media planner making decisions based on domain knowledge will beat an AI system that’s still in cold start after two years of “learning.”\nThe broader lesson\nThis isn’t just about advertising. It’s about a fundamental limitation of AI:\nsystems require sufficient feedback density to work.\nWe’re seeing US-designed AI being deployed globally — in HR, healthcare, finance, logistics — without consideration for whether there’s enough local data to make the algorithms work. The results are predictably bad.\nIn advertising, the symptom is endless “learning” that never converges. In other domains, it looks like biased recommendations, poor predictions, or system instability.\nBefore deploying AI optimization in ad systems, ask:\nHow many feedback events do we get per time period?\nHow many does the algorithm actually need to converge?\nWill we ever reach that number in this market?\nIf the answer is no, simplify. You’ll be worse off trusting feedback-based AI optimnisation, than a using simpler system that matches your constraints.\nTakeaways\nAI optimization systems are powerful, but they’re not magic. They need data, lots of it, and smaller markets simply don’t provide it.\nThe US-centric design of most ad platforms means sophisticated features break down when you scale down. In markets like Germany or Sweden, the right approach is often:\nSimpler test designs\nHigher-frequency proxies\nMore human oversight\nAcceptance that “full personalization” isn’t mathematically feasible\nSometimes the most sophisticated solution is to recognize the limits of sophistication.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nFlorian Teschner\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",

Accept manual beats broken automation</h3>\n<p>Sometimes the best “AI” is a human who understands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your specific market dynamics</li>\n<li>Seasonal patterns unique to your region</li>\n<li>Creative and messaging that resonates locally</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An experienced media planner making decisions based on domain knowledge will beat an AI system that’s still in cold start after two years of “learning.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-broader-lesson\">The broader lesson</h2>\n<p>This isn’t just about advertising. It’s about a fundamental limitation of AI: <strong>systems require sufficient feedback density to work.</strong></p>\n<p>We’re seeing US-designed AI being deployed globally — in HR, healthcare, finance, logistics — without consideration for whether there’s enough local data to make the algorithms work. The results are predictably bad.</p>\n<p>In advertising, the symptom is endless “learning” that never converges. In other domains, it looks like biased recommendations, poor predictions, or system instability.</p>\n<p>Before deploying AI optimization in ad systems, ask:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How many feedback events do we get per time period?</li>\n<li>How many does the algorithm actually need to converge?</li>\n<li>Will we ever reach that number in this market?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the answer is no, simplify. You’ll be worse off trusting feedback-based AI optimnisation, than a using simpler system that matches your constraints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\">Takeaways</h2>\n<p>AI optimization systems are powerful, but they’re not magic. They need data, lots of it, and smaller markets simply don’t provide it.</p>\n<p>The US-centric design of most ad platforms means sophisticated features break down when you scale down. In markets like Germany or Sweden, the right approach is often:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simpler test designs</li>\n<li>Higher-frequency proxies</li>\n<li>More human oversight</li>\n<li>Acceptance that “full personalization” isn’t mathematically feasible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes the most sophisticated solution is to recognize the limits of sophistication.</p>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid; background: none repeat scroll 0 0 #EDEDED; margin: 1px; font-size: 13px;\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">To <strong>leave a comment</strong> for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: <strong><a href=\"http://flovv.github.io/limits-of-ai-optimization/\"> Florian Teschner</a></strong>.</div>\n<hr/>\n<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R-bloggers.com</a> offers <strong><a href=\"https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=RBloggers\" rel=\"nofollow\">daily e-mail updates</a></strong> about <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The R Project for Statistical Computing\">R</a> news and tutorials about <a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R tutorials\">learning R</a> and many other topics. <a href=\"https://www.r-users.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Data science jobs\">Click here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job</a>.\r\n\r\n<hr/>Want to share your content on R-bloggers?<a href=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/add-your-blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> click here</a> if you have a blog, or <a href=\"http://r-posts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> here</a> if you don't.\r\n</div> </div>\n</article>",
