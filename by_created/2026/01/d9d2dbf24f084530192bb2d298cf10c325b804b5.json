Sparks: Downloads and imports agricultural data from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES)\nhttps://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares\nand the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)\nhttps://www.abs.gov.au\n. Supports multiple data formats including spreadsheets, comma‑separated value (CSV) files, and geospatial data such as shapefiles and GeoTIFFs. Covers topics such as broadacre crops, livestock, soils, commodities and related agricultural information. The package standardises field names and data formats to improve interoperability and simplify analysis. It also streamlines the import of geospatial data and corrects common issues found in these data sources upon loading. It is available on\nCRAN\n. It has been\nreviewed\nby Nicholas Potter and María Paula Caldas.\ndfms\n, developed by Sebastian Krantz together with Rytis Bagdziunas: Efficient estimation of Dynamic Factor Models using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm or Two-Step (2S) estimation, supporting datasets with missing data and mixed-frequency nowcasting applications. Factors follow a stationary VAR process of order p. Estimation options include: running the Kalman Filter and Smoother once with PCA initial values (2S) as in Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2011)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2011.02.012\n; iterated Kalman Filtering and Smoothing until EM convergence as in Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2012)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00225\n; or the adapted EM algorithm of Banbura and Modugno (2014)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/jae.2306\n, allowing arbitrary missing-data patterns and monthly-quarterly mixed-frequency datasets. The implementation uses the Armadillo C++ library and the collapse package for fast estimation. A comprehensive set of methods supports interpretation and visualization, forecasting, and decomposition of the news content of macroeconomic data releases following Banbura and Modugno (2014). Information criteria to choose the number of factors are also provided, following Bai and Ng (2002)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0262.00273\n. It is available on\nCRAN\n.

The process is to have users open a discussion using GitHub Discussions, then to convert the discussion to an issue if relevant.\n“This approach is based on years of experience maintaining open source projects and observing that 80-90% of what users think are bugs are either misunderstandings, environmental problems, or configuration errors by the users themselves. For what’s left, the majority are often feature requests (unimplemented features) and not bugs (malfunctioning features). Of the features requests, almost all are underspecified and require more guidance by a maintainer to be worked on.”\nThe tldraw project announced that they no longer\naccept PRs from external contributors\n. In this case, the motivation is to not waste precious developers’ time on AI slop.\n“Like many other open-source projects on GitHub, we’ve recently seen a significant increase in contributions generated entirely by AI tools. While some of these pull requests are formally correct, most suffer from incomplete or misleading context, misunderstanding of the codebase, and little to no follow-up engagement from their authors.”\nNew JOSS policy on AI\nRead about the Journal of Open Source Software updated its\nsubmission requirements\nto adapt JOSS for a world with heavy AI use for software development.\nLast words\nThanks for reading!

Factors follow a stationary VAR process of order p. Estimation options include: running the Kalman Filter and Smoother once with PCA initial values (2S) as in Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2011) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2011.02.012\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2011.02.012</a>; iterated Kalman Filtering and Smoothing until EM convergence as in Doz, Giannone and Reichlin (2012) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00225\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00225</a>; or the adapted EM algorithm of Banbura and Modugno (2014) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.2306\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.2306</a>, allowing arbitrary missing-data patterns and monthly-quarterly mixed-frequency datasets. The implementation uses the Armadillo C++ library and the collapse package for fast estimation.

The process is to have users open a discussion using GitHub Discussions, then to convert the discussion to an issue if relevant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This approach is based on years of experience maintaining open source projects and observing that 80-90% of what users think are bugs are either misunderstandings, environmental problems, or configuration errors by the users themselves. For what’s left, the majority are often feature requests (unimplemented features) and not bugs (malfunctioning features). Of the features requests, almost all are underspecified and require more guidance by a maintainer to be worked on.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The tldraw project announced that they no longer <a href=\"https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7695\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">accept PRs from external contributors</a>. In this case, the motivation is to not waste precious developers’ time on AI slop.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Like many other open-source projects on GitHub, we’ve recently seen a significant increase in contributions generated entirely by AI tools. While some of these pull requests are formally correct, most suffer from incomplete or misleading context, misunderstanding of the codebase, and little to no follow-up engagement from their authors.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nNew JOSS policy on AI\n</h3><p>Read about the Journal of Open Source Software updated its <a href=\"https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2026/01/preparing-joss-for-a-generative-ai-future\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">submission requirements</a> to adapt JOSS for a world with heavy AI use for software development.</p>\n<h2>\nLast words\n</h2><p>Thanks for reading!
