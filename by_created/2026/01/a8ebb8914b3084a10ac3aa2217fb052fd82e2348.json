  "meta_description": "Enjoyed learning the process of setting up a cluster of tiny PCs for parallel computing. A note to myself on installing Ubuntu, passwordless SSH, automating package installation across nodes, distributing R simulations, and comparing CV5 vs CV10 performance. Fun project! Motivations Part of something I want to learn this year is getting a little more into parallel computing. How we can distribute simulation computations across different devices. Lately, we have more reasons to do this because quite a few of our simulations require long running computation and leaving my laptop running overnight or several days is just not a good use it. We have also tried cloud computing as well and without knowing how those distributed cores are, well, distributed, it’s hard for me to conceptualize how these are done and what else we could optimize. Hence, what is a better way of doing it on our own! Sit tight, this is going to be a bumpy one. Let’s go! Objectives Which PCs to get? Install Ubuntu Align and fix IPs Passwordless ssh Send multiple commands via ssh Install R Create A Template R script For Simulation Install Packages On All Nodes Upload Rscript to Nodes Run Rscript Extract data Compare time Opportunities for improvement Lessons learnt Which PCs to Get? Preferably something functional and cheap! Something like a used Lenovo M715q Tiny PCs or something similar. Install Ubuntu Download Ubuntu Server Create a bootable USB using balenaEtcher When starting Lenovo up, press F12 continuously until it shows an option to boot from USB. If F12 does not work, reboot and press F1 to BIOS. Go to Startup Tab, change CSM Support to Enabled. Then set Primary Boot Priority to USB by moving priority to first. Then F10 to save configuration and exit. It will then reboot to USB. Make sure it’s connected to internet via LAN for smoother installation. Follow the instructions to install Ubuntu, setting username, password etc. Then reboot. Make sure to remove USB drive, if you didn’t it’ll remind you. Et voila! The installations were very quick, compared to the other OS I’ve installed in the past. Very smooth as well. I thoroughly enjoyed seeting these up. Align and Fix IPs For organizational purpose, make sure you go to your router setting and set your computer clusters to convenient IPs such as 192.168.1.101, 192.168.1.102, 192.168.1.103 etc. You may have to reboot your computer clusters after changing it on your router. Passwordless SSH Next, you want to set up passwordless SSH. This is crucial for R to work! 1. Create a key ssh-keygen -t ed25519 2. Send Copy of Key To Your Node ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/my_key.pub username1@192.168.1.101 it will prompt you to enter your password, then after that you won’t need a pssword to ssh in. Passwordless Sudo This is optional. But if you’re like me, don’t want to repeat lots of typing on installation, and see if you can use bash or R to install packages, you’d need this. ssh -t username2@192.168.1.102 'echo \"$(whoami) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$(whoami)' It would prompt you to enter your password. You would have to do this for all your nodes Send Multiple Commands Via SSH Install R for host in username1@192.168.1.101 username2@192.168.1.102 username3@192.168.1.103; do ssh -t $host 'sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y r-base r-base-dev' done This is basically installing R on all of our clusters one after another. Create A Template R script For Simulation Why do we do this? We want to take advantage of the multicore of each nodes as opposed to using clusters on future as the overhead network may add on to the time and makes optimization less efficiency. Instead, we will send a script to each node so that it can fork its own cores to run the simulation. Also, if we specify packages on our script, we can automate the process of installing these packages on our nodes. code library(future) library(future.apply) library(dplyr) library(SuperLearner) library(ranger) library(xgboost) library(glmnet) plan(multicore, workers = 4) set.seed(1) n",

And also instruction to save result. This is when we can put a little more effort in incorporating some instructions to inform us when task is completed (e.g., via email) and also it would also be nice to know what is the ETA of the entire task by perhaps benchmarking how long the first iteration took to complete, then multiple by total iters per node. Again, this can be sent via email, and also maybe only for the first node as opposed to all nodes, so we’re not bombarded with messages beginning and the end. 🤣\nInstall Packages On All Nodes\n## List all of our nodes\nmy_clusters <- list(\n  c(\"\n[email protected]\n\"),\n  c(\"\n[email protected]\n\"),\n  c(\"\n[email protected]\n\"))\n\n## Grab all of the packages needed on our script  \npackages <- gsub(\"library\\\\(([^)]+)\\\\)\", \"\\\\1\",grep(\"^library\",readLines(\"par_test_script.R\"),value = T))\n\n## Create function to run sudo\nremote_r_sudo <- function(host, r_code, intern = FALSE) {\n  escaped <- gsub('\"', '\\\\\\\\\"', r_code)\n  cmd <- sprintf(\"ssh %s 'sudo Rscript -e \\\"%s\\\"'\", host, escaped)\n  system(cmd, intern = intern)\n}\n\n## Loop over to install\nfor (cluster_i in my_clusters) {\n  print(cluster_i)\n  for (package in packages) {\n  command <- sprintf('if (!require(\"%s\")) install.packages(\"%s\")', package, package)\n  remote_r_sudo(cluster_i, command)\n  }\n}\nMake sure your computer doesn’t go to sleep with this. If this is the first time your nodes are installing these extensive libraries, it will take a while. Another way we can do this is to use\nfuture_lapply\nfor all nodes and also\ntmux\nfor all installations so that we don’t need to rely on our local workstation to be turned on to continue with the installation. See below on how we used\ntmux\nto set and forget method.\nUpload Rscript to Nodes\nAlright, now we have installed the appropriate packages above, let’s upload scripts to our nodes.\nDistribute Work\nnum_list <- list()\nclust_num <- 3\ntotal_loop <- 1000\ndiv_iter <- total_loop/clust_num\nfinal_iter <- total_loop #only use this for custom e.g., if one node did not work and it's in charge of 300:500, we can put 500 for this and set first_iter as 300\nfirst_iter <- 1\nlast_iter <- round(div_iter,0) + first_iter\n\nfor (i in 1:clust_num) {\n  if (i == clust_num) {\n    num_list[[i]] <- paste0(first_iter,\":\",final_iter)\n    next\n  }\n  num_list[[i]] <- paste0(first_iter,\":\",last_iter)\n  first_iter <- round(first_iter + div_iter, 0) \n  last_iter <- round(last_iter + div_iter, 0)\n}\n\nnum_list\n\n## [[1]]\n## [1] \"1:334\"\n## \n## [[2]]\n## [1] \"334:667\"\n## \n## [[3]]\n## [1] \"667:1000\"\n\nfor (i in 1:length(my_clusters)) {\n  username <- sub(\"@.*\",\"\",my_clusters[[i]])\n  system(sprintf(\"sed 's/START:END/%s/g' par_test_script.R > par_test_script1.R & scp par_test_script1.R %s:/home/%s/par_test_script1.R\",num_list[[i]],my_clusters[[i]],username))\n}\nWe’ll iterate and insert the appropriate iters for each node and save it to\npar_test_script1.R\n. Then upload to each nodes with the code above.\nCheck set.seed in multicore\nsample_df <- function(seed, df, n = 6000) {\n  set.seed(seed)\n  df_sample <- slice_sample(n = n, .data = df)\n  return(df_sample)\n}\n\nfuture_lapply(100, function(x) sample_df(seed=x,df=df))\nWhen we did the above on local computer and also in terminal with multicore. It’s still the same! Woo hoo!\nThe interesting thing is I didn’t have to set\nfuture.seed = T\nor\nfuture.seed = some_number\nfor this. However, if we put a number on future.seed, it will return the reproducible data! This is great, next time I’ll just use this seed and I don’t have to use\nset.seed(i)\n. 🙌\nRun Rscript\nfor (i in 1:length(my_clusters)) {\n  # set your tmux new session name, here we call it \"test\"\n  cluster_name <- \"test\"\n  \n  # terminate any existing tmux with the existing name\n  system(sprintf(\"ssh %s 'tmux kill-session -t %s 2>/dev/null || true'\", my_clusters[[i]], cluster_name))\n  \n  # create new tmux session\n  system(sprintf(\"ssh %s 'tmux new-session -d -s %s'\", my_clusters[[i]], cluster_name))\n  \n  # run rscript in tmux\n  system(sprintf(\"ssh %s 'tmux send-keys -t %s \\\"Rscript par_test_script1.R > result_%d.txt\\\"' ENTER\",\n                 my_clusters[[i]], cluster_name, i))\n}\nThe code above is quite self-explanatory. Once the above code is run and completed, there we have it! it should be running in the background! 🙌 You can do a spot check and see if it’s actually running. Once completed, we’ll extract the data.\nExtract Data\nSince we have 10 combinations we want to assess, we will set nums as 1:10 and get our data! On your template script you can set however you want to save your data, and for extraction, just look for those and download them, read and merge! Or however you want to do it.\nnums <- 1:10\ndf <- tibble()\nfor (num in nums) {\n  print(num)\nfor (i in 1:length(my_clusters)) {\n  response <- system(sprintf(\"scp %s:tmle_results/simulation_parameters%d.csv simulation_parameters%d.csv\", my_clusters[[i]], num, num), intern = F)\n  if (response == 1) { next }\n  df_i <- read_csv(paste0(\"simulation_parameters\",num,\".csv\"), show_col_types = F) \n  sl_i <- df_i |> filter(parameter == \"SL_library\") |> pull(value)\n  df <- rbind(df, df_i |> mutate(method = sl_i, num = num))\n}\n}\n\ndf_sim_param <- df\n\ndf <- tibble()\nfor (num in nums) {\nfor (i in 1:length(my_clusters)) {\n  response <- system(sprintf(\"scp %s:tmle_results/tmle_iterations%d.csv tmle_iterations%d.csv\", my_clusters[[i]], num, num), intern = F)\n  if (response == 1) { print(paste0(my_clusters[[i]],\" is missing num\", num)) ; next }\n  df_i <- read_csv(paste0(\"tmle_iterations\",num,\".csv\"), show_col_types = F) |>\n    mutate(num = num)\n  df <- rbind(df, df_i)\n}\n}\n\ndf_iter <- df\nTake note that sometimes you may encounter issues, if for some reason the node is unable to complete the task, you can identify it then redistribute those tasks to the entire computer cluster.\nCompare Time\nLet’s take at our compute time for 1 cluster, 3 cluster with 5-fold cv, 3 cluster with 10-fold cv.\nmethod\nhour_1clus_cv5\nhour_3clus_cv5\nhour_3clus_cv10\nSL.xgboost, SL.ranger, SL.glm, SL.mean\n4.02\n1.4126466\n2.5179200\nSL.xgboost, SL.ranger\n4.00\n1.4136567\n2.5108584\nSL.xgboost, SL.glm\n0.47\n0.1680019\n0.3034212\nSL.ranger, c(\"SL.xgboost\", \"screen.glmnet\")\n4.23\n1.4960542\n2.5165429\nSL.glmnet, SL.glm\nNA\n0.1074466\n0.1995869\nSL.ranger, SL.glm\nNA\n1.2544446\n2.2254909\nxgb_500_5_0.001, xgb_1000_5_0.001, xgb_500_7_0.001, xgb_1000_7_0.001, xgb_500_5_0.01, xgb_1000_5_0.01, xgb_500_7_0.01, xgb_1000_7_0.01, SL.glm\n3.29\n1.8059939\n3.3030737\nxgb_500_5_0.001, xgb_1000_5_0.001, xgb_500_7_0.001, xgb_1000_7_0.001, xgb_500_5_0.01, xgb_1000_5_0.01, xgb_500_7_0.01, xgb_1000_7_0.01, SL.glmnet\nNA\n1.8956873\n3.4821903\nSL.gam, SL.glm\nNA\n0.1094693\n0.2072266\nxgb_250_3_0.001, xgb_500_3_0.001, xgb_1000_3_0.001, xgb_250_5_0.001, xgb_500_5_0.001, xgb_1000_5_0.001, xgb_250_7_0.001, xgb_500_7_0.001, xgb_1000_7_0.001, xgb_250_9_0.001, xgb_500_9_0.001, xgb_1000_9_0.001, xgb_250_3_0.005, xgb_500_3_0.005, xgb_1000_3_0.005, xgb_250_5_0.005, xgb_500_5_0.005, xgb_1000_5_0.005, xgb_250_7_0.005, xgb_500_7_0.005, xgb_1000_7_0.005, xgb_250_9_0.005, xgb_500_9_0.005, xgb_1000_9_0.005, xgb_250_3_0.01, xgb_500_3_0.01, xgb_1000_3_0.01, xgb_250_5_0.01, xgb_500_5_0.01, xgb_1000_5_0.01, xgb_250_7_0.01, xgb_500_7_0.01, xgb_1000_7_0.01, xgb_250_9_0.01, xgb_500_9_0.01, xgb_1000_9_0.01, SL.glm\nNA\nNA\n4.6127172\nLooking at the time, we can definitely see the improvement of time from 1 cluster to 3 cluster. Take a look at our good old tuned xgboost and logistic regression, it took use previously for a quadcore 3.29 hours to complete, down to 1.8 hours. You’d imagine that if we use 3 pc’s as a cluster, we would notice improvement to ~1.1 hours, but I guess not for xgboost. Will have to investigate this. But if we look at xgboost + logistic regression without tuning, we went from 0.47 hours to 0.17 hours which made sense! Very interesting. Now if we up our CV to 10 fold, then we see that it took longer (makes senses), but still better than using 1 quadcore. I’ve heard people said that if you increase your K-fold CV, you reduce your bias, but increase variance.

Let's visualize it!\n5-fold CV\ncode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nnum_df <- sim_param_cv5_clus5 |>\n  select(num, method)\n\ndf_coverage <- df_iter_cv5_clus3 |>\n  group_by(num) |>\n  arrange(ate) |>\n  mutate(iter = row_number()) |>\n  mutate(cover = case_when(\n    covers_truth == F & ate < true_ATE ~ \"right_missed\",\n    covers_truth == F & ate > true_ATE ~ \"left_missed\",\n    covers_truth == T ~ \"covered\"\n  )) |>\n  select(num, cover) |>\n  group_by(num, cover) |>\n  tally() |>\n  ungroup(cover) |>\n  mutate(prop = n*100/sum(n)) |>\n  pivot_wider(id_cols = num, names_from = \"cover\", values_from = \"prop\") |>\n  mutate(text = paste0(\"right missed: \",right_missed,\"% covered: \",covered,\"% left missed: \",left_missed,\"%\")) |>\n  select(num, text)\n\nmethod <- tibble(\n  num = c(1:9),\n  method = c(\"xgb + rf + lr + mean\",\"xgb + rf\",\"xgb + lr\",\"rf + (xgb + preprocess w glmnet)\",\"glmnet + lr\",\"rf + lr\",\"tuned xgb + lr\",\"tuned xgb + glmnet\",\"gam + lr\")\n)\n\nplot <- df_iter_cv5_clus3 |>\n  group_by(num) |>\n  arrange(ate) |>\n  mutate(iter = row_number()) |>\n  mutate(cover = case_when(\n    covers_truth == F & ate < true_ATE ~ \"right_missed\",\n    covers_truth == F & ate > true_ATE ~ \"left_missed\",\n    covers_truth == T ~ \"covered\"\n  )) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=iter,y=ate,color=cover)) +\n  geom_point(alpha=0.2) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x=iter,ymin=ci_lower,ymax=ci_upper), alpha=0.2) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0.0373518), color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(data = df_coverage,\n            aes(x = 500, label = text),\n            y = -0.05,  \n            inherit.aes = FALSE,\n            size = 3,\n            hjust = 0.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"covered\" = \"#619CFF\", \n                                  \"left_missed\" = \"#F8766D\", \n                                  \"right_missed\" = \"#00BA38\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  facet_wrap(.~num, ncol = 1,labeller = as_labeller(setNames(method$method, method$num))) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\nlr\n: logistic regression,\nxgb\n: xgboost,\nrf\n: random forest,\ngam\n: generalized additive model.\nWow, look at gam + lr’s assymetrical coverage! This is so true then when we’re assessing, a point estimate of coverage is not adequate to assess the global usefulness of a method. We can see that this method is very bias indeed with asymmetrical tails. Since CV5 and CV10 do not have significant difference in coverage, we’ll skip the visualization.\nOpportunities for improvement\nplenty of opportunities to turn our personal project into a package that will help us\nUse parallel computing on local to run system (such as installation) since this takes a lot of time\nWrite function to let us know when tasks are completed\nWrite function to estimate time of completion\nWrite function to redistribute missing iterations\nlearn openMPI\nmake a package for the functions above so I can reuse in the future\nLessons Learnt:\nused more\nsprintf\nwith this learning experience when using with system.\nlearn that in\nfuture_lapply\nin multicore\nfuture.seed=100 or whatever number\nwill help reproduce the same data\nMade a few pipeline to install packages on multiple nodes\nlearnt set.seed in multicore works fine\nobserved reduced bias with increase variance from cv5 to cv10\nIf you like this article:\nplease feel free to send me a\ncomment or visit my other blogs\nplease feel free to follow me on\nBlueSky\n,\ntwitter\n,\nGitHub\nor\nMastodon\nif you would like collaborate please feel free to\ncontact me\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nr on Everyday Is A School Day\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",

How we can distribute simulation computations across different devices. Lately, we have more reasons to do this because quite a few of our simulations require long running computation and leaving my laptop running overnight or several days is just not a good use it. We have also tried cloud computing as well and without knowing how those distributed cores are, well, distributed, it’s hard for me to conceptualize how these are done and what else we could optimize. Hence, what is a better way of doing it on our own! Sit tight, this is going to be a bumpy one.

We want to take advantage of the <code>multicore</code> of each nodes as opposed to using <code>clusters</code> on <code>future</code> as the overhead network may add on to the time and makes optimization less efficiency. Instead, we will send a script to each node so that it can fork its own cores to run the simulation. Also, if we specify packages on our script, we can automate the process of installing these packages on our nodes.</p>\n<details>\n<summary>code</summary>\n<pre>library(future)\nlibrary(future.apply)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(SuperLearner)\nlibrary(ranger)\nlibrary(xgboost)\nlibrary(glmnet)\n\nplan(multicore, workers = 4)\n\nset.seed(1)\n\nn &lt;- 10000\nW1 &lt;- rnorm(n)\nW2 &lt;- rnorm(n)\nW3 &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)\nW4 &lt;- rnorm(n)\n\n# TRUE propensity score model\nA &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-0.5 + 0.8*W1 + 0.5*W2^2 + 0.3*W3 - 0.4*W1*W2 + 0.2*W4))\n\n# TRUE outcome model\nY &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-1 + 0.2*A + 0.6*W1 - 0.4*W2^2 + 0.5*W3 + 0.3*W1*W3 + 0.2*W4^2))\n\n# Calculate TRUE ATE\nlogit_Y1 &lt;- -1 + 0.2 + 0.6*W1 - 0.4*W2^2 + 0.5*W3 + 0.3*W1*W3 + 0.2*W4^2\nlogit_Y0 &lt;- -1 + 0 + 0.6*W1 - 0.4*W2^2 + 0.5*W3 + 0.3*W1*W3 + 0.2*W4^2\n\nY1_true &lt;- plogis(logit_Y1)\nY0_true &lt;- plogis(logit_Y0)\ntrue_ATE &lt;- mean(Y1_true - Y0_true)\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(W1 = W1, W2 = W2, W3 = W3, W4 = W4, A = A, Y = Y)\n\ntune &lt;- list(\n  ntrees = c(500,1000),           \n  max_depth = c(5,7),                  \n  shrinkage = c(0.001,0.01)    \n)\n\ntune2 &lt;- list(\n  ntrees = c(250, 500, 1000),\n  max_depth = c(3,5,7,9),\n  shrinkage = c(0.001,0.005,0.01)\n)\n\nlearners &lt;- create.Learner(\"SL.xgboost\", tune = tune, detailed_names = TRUE, name_prefix = \"xgb\")\nlearners2 &lt;- create.Learner(\"SL.xgboost\", tune = tune2, detailed_names = TRUE, name_prefix = \"xgb\")\n\n# Super Learner library \nSL_library &lt;- list(\n  c(\"SL.xgboost\", \"SL.ranger\", \"SL.glm\", \"SL.mean\"),\n  c(\"SL.xgboost\",\"SL.ranger\"),\n  c(\"SL.xgboost\",\"SL.glm\"),\n  list(\"SL.ranger\", c(\"SL.xgboost\", \"screen.glmnet\")),\n  c(\"SL.glmnet\",\"SL.glm\"),\n  c(\"SL.ranger\",\"SL.glm\"),\n  c(learners$names, \"SL.glm\"),\n  c(learners$names, \"SL.glmnet\"),\n  c(\"SL.gam\",\"SL.glm\"),\n  c(learners2$names, \"SL.glm\"))\n\n# sample\nallnum &lt;- START:END\nn_sample &lt;- length(allnum)\nn_i &lt;- 6000\n\n# Function to run one TMLE iteration\nrun_tmle_iteration &lt;- function(seed_val, df, n_i, SL_library) {\n  set.seed(seed_val)\n  data &lt;- slice_sample(df, n = n_i, replace = T) |&gt;

And also instruction to save result. This is when we can put a little more effort in incorporating some instructions to inform us when task is completed (e.g., via email) and also it would also be nice to know what is the ETA of the entire task by perhaps benchmarking how long the first iteration took to complete, then multiple by total iters per node. Again, this can be sent via email, and also maybe only for the first node as opposed to all nodes, so we’re not bombarded with messages beginning and the end. 🤣</p>\n<h3 id=\"install-packages\">Install Packages On All Nodes\n  <a href=\"https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/parallel-computing/#install-packages\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h3>\n<pre>## List all of our nodes\nmy_clusters &lt;- list(\n  c(\"<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"81f4f2e4f3efe0ece4b0c1b0b8b3afb0b7b9afb0afb0b1b0\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>\"),\n  c(\"<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f2878197809c939f97c0b2c3cbc0dcc3c4cadcc3dcc3c2c0\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>\"),\n  c(\"<a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"14616771667a7579712754252d263a25222c3a253a252427\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>\"))\n\n\n## Grab all of the packages needed on our script  \npackages &lt;- gsub(\"library\\\\(([^)]+)\\\\)\", \"\\\\1\",grep(\"^library\",readLines(\"par_test_script.R\"),value = T))\n\n## Create function to run sudo\nremote_r_sudo &lt;- function(host, r_code, intern = FALSE) {\n  escaped &lt;- gsub('\"', '\\\\\\\\\"', r_code)\n  cmd &lt;- sprintf(\"ssh %s 'sudo Rscript -e \\\"%s\\\"'\", host, escaped)\n  system(cmd, intern = intern)\n}\n\n## Loop over to install\nfor (cluster_i in my_clusters) {\n  print(cluster_i)\n  for (package in packages) {\n  command &lt;- sprintf('if (!require(\"%s\")) install.packages(\"%s\")', package, package)\n  remote_r_sudo(cluster_i, command)\n  }\n}\n</pre><p>Make sure your computer doesn’t go to sleep with this.

Take a look at our good old tuned xgboost and logistic regression, it took use previously for a quadcore 3.29 hours to complete, down to 1.8 hours. You’d imagine that if we use 3 pc’s as a cluster, we would notice improvement to ~1.1 hours, but I guess not for xgboost. Will have to investigate this. But if we look at xgboost + logistic regression without tuning, we went from 0.47 hours to 0.17 hours which made sense! Very interesting. Now if we up our CV to 10 fold, then we see that it took longer (makes senses), but still better than using 1 quadcore. I’ve heard people said that if you increase your K-fold CV, you reduce your bias, but increase variance.

Indeed when we went from cv5 to cv10, we have reduced bias and slightly increased variance! How about that. Everything except gam + lr, which make sense because we don’t really tune them. Though that being said, I wonder what’s under the hood that controls the knot for gam in superlearner. Will need to check that out. With this, it looks like tuned xgboost + lr might have the best numbers.

But looking at bias from the previous table, it's actually quite horrible. So it seems like gam + lr is assymetrical in its estimates, sometimes overestimating, sometimes underestimating, leading to a wider confidence interval, hence more coverage. But that being said, it's not a good estimator because of its bias. Tuned xgboost + glmnet seems to be the best bet here with low bias, low variance and decent coverage.\nWow, I was not expecting gam + lr to have so much coverage! But looking at bias from the previous table, it's actually quite horrible.
