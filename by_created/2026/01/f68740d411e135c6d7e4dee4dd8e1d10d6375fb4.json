This is, as you’ll see if you watch, one of the themes of the talk in the first place. In my case, in addition to all the good work by people in the general area of data visualization and data science, I was able to talk about some ideas from social theory and, in addition, some of the work of\nKatherine Hawley\non trust and commitment.
