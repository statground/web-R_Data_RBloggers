(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nMotivation\nA few months back in a side skirmish during the great p-curve controversy,\nRichard McElreath mentioned\nthat p-values under the null hypothesis are not always uniformly distributed, as is sometimes claimed. This prompted me to check out the phenomenon. I’ll admit I had in my head the basic idea that p-values are indeed uniformly distributed if the null hypothesis is true. It turns out this is only ‘often’ the case, not always.\nAs is commonly the case for this blog, the main motivation was to make sure I understood something myself, so there’s nothing particularly new for the world in this blog. But it might be interesting for some. There were a few odd fishhooks.\nI wanted to check the case where we are comparing the number of “successes” in a relatively small sample of binary success/failure outcomes, split into two groups. The null hypothesis is that the underlying probability for success is the same in each group. I wanted to see the distribution of the p-value for a test of this null hypothesis with sample sizes of 10, 100 or 1000 observations in each group; for different values of the underlying probability of success, and for when the groups’ sample size is random but mean 100.\nCalculating the p value\nThe fishhooks were in how to calculate the p value. I actually went for three different ways:\nMy lazy approximation way is to estimate the variance of the difference between the two sample proportions under the null hypothesis and rely on asymptotic normality to get a probability of the value being as extreme as it actually is. This has the disadvantage of being known to be not particularly right particularly when the sample is small or the probability of success is close to 1 or 0. The advantage is I didn’t need to look anything up and it was easy to vectorise. This method is called\npval_hand\nin the plot below.\nA better method is to use the\nFisher exact test\n, as per the famous lady-tasting-tea analysis, but the out of the box method I was using (from the\ncorpora\nR package by Stephanie Evert) doesn’t work when the observed successes in both samples is zero. This method is called\npval_fisher\nin the plot below.\nThe most out-of-the-box method of all is to use the\nprop.test()\nfunction from the\nstats\npackage built into R. The disadvantage here was the bother in vectorising this function to run efficiently with large numbers of simulations. This method is called\npval_proptest\nin the plot below.\nBecause I was nervous about whether these methods might give materially different results I started by comparing the results they gave, with different sample sizes and underlying parameters, with just 1,000 repetitions for each combination of sample size and parameter. This gives this comparison:\nSo we can see that the\npval_fisher\nand\npval_proptest\nmethods give effectively the same results, whereas my hand-made method has a significant number of discrepancies. Because of this I decided to stick with Evert’s\ncorpora::fisher.pval\n. I just hardened it up with a wrapper function to define the p value (chance of seeing data as extreme as this, if the null hypothesis is true) to be 1 if the observed successes are 0 in both samples:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(corpora)\nlibrary(GGally)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(frs) # for svg_png()\n\n#' Version of fisher.pval that won't break if k1 and k2 both 0\ntough_fisher <- function(k1, n1, k2, n2, set_both_zero = 1, ...){\n  problems <- k1 + k2 == 0\n  k1[problems] <- 1\n  temp <- corpora::fisher.pval(k1, n1, k2, n2)\n  temp[problems] <- set_both_zero\n  return(temp)\n}\n# note needed a decision on what to do when k1 and k2 are both zero. I think\n# p value is 1 here, as p is the \"probability of seeing data at least as extreme\n# as this if the null hypothesis of no difference is true\". Not sure why Fisher's\n# exact test returns an error, worth looking into that.\nResults\nSo with that problem out of the way, I set out to calculate lots of p-values. I did this in the situations\nwhere the two groups were equally sized with 10, 100, or 1,000 observations each; or where they are a random number of observations, mean 100, still the same for each of the two groups; and\nwith an underlying probability of success of 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8.\nThe intution for some of the reason of why the p-values aren’t uniformly distributed is that with a finite sample and a a discrete outcome, there are only a finite number of possible values for the p-value. So of course it can’t have a perfectly uniform distribution, which implies a p-value taking any value between 0 and 1 with equal probability. Further down we see (approximately) how many possible values the p-value takes. The smaller the sample sizes, the more we would expect to see divergence from normality.\nAnd that is exactly what we do see. Here is the full distribution of p-values for 100,000 simulations of each combination:\n… and here is the distribution just of the p-values that are conventionally “significant” ie below 0.05:\nI think there are a few interesting subtleties here. In particular:\nWhen the size of the two groups is a random variable (but still equal) then the distribution of p-values is much more uniform (but still not exactly uniform). Basically there are many more possibiliities for the p-values to take with this extra randomness.\nThe p-values are more non-uniform when the underlying probability for success is 0.5 in each case rather than 0.2 or 0.8\nThe p-values can still be very non-uniform even with a large sample size of 1,000 observations per group (if underlying probability of success is close to 0.5)\nHere’s a potentialy interesting little insight into one of the reasons why this works that way - the\nnumber\nof different unique p-values that we get for each combination of sample size and underlying probabilities:\nsize_lab    `Prob=0.2` `Prob=0.5` `Prob=0.8`\n  <chr>            <int>      <int>      <int>\n1 n=10                32         38         31\n2 n=100              391        533        403\n3 n=1000            2915       3853       2903\n4 n=Pois(100)       9812      12582       9898\nI’m not drawing any conclusions in any metascience debates here. Just noting this interesting phenomenon in the distribution of p-values.\nHere’s the rest of the code for doing these simulations.\n# Takes about 30 seconds with 100,000 reps\nst <- system.time({\n  for(reps in c(1e3, 1e5)){\n    set.seed(42)\n    \n    d <- expand_grid(\n      prob = rep(c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8), each = reps),\n      size = c(10, 100, 1000, NA)\n    ) |> \n      mutate(size_lab = ifelse(is.na(size), \"n=Pois(100)\", glue(\"n={size}\")),\n             prob_lab = glue(\"Prob={prob}\")) |> \n      mutate(size = ifelse(is.na(size), rpois(n(), 100), size)) |> \n      mutate(x1 = rbinom(n(), size = size, prob = prob),\n            x2 = rbinom(n(), size = size, prob = prob),\n            # observed proportions p1 and p2 from the two populations\n            p1 = x1 / size,\n            p2 = x2 / size,\n            # under null hypothesis, the equal probability of both pops:\n            pmid = (p1 + p2) / 2,\n            # observed difference of the two proportions:\n            delt = abs(p1 - p2),\n            # variance of each of p1 and p2: p(1-p)/n\n            s1 = pmid * (1 - pmid) / size,\n            # standard deviation of the sum of two of those variances\n            sddelt = sqrt(s1 + s1)) |> \n      # calculate p values\n      mutate(pval_hand = 2 * (1 - pnorm(delt / sddelt)),\n             pval_fisher = tough_fisher(x1, size, x2, size),\n             pval_proptest = NA)\n  \n    if(reps < 10000){\n      # when the number of reps is fairly small, I draw a pairs plot just to\n      # compare the different ways of calculating p values:\n      # - prop.test (out of the box R method).
