Just the opposite: If a director has had a film nominated or won Best Picture before, it actually\nhurts\ntheir chances of winning in my model.\nThat was then, this is now, though. No more awards in my models will name nominees or winners before the Oscar nominations. Where do we stand going into the announcement?\nOne Battle After Another\nis the favorite, at about 15% chance of winning. Following it closely is\nThe Secret Agent\n(10%), followed by\nMarty Supreme\n(9%),\nHamnet\n(8%),\nWicked: For Good\n(8%), and\nFrankenstein\n(8%).\nYou can read more about the details of the model from\nmy post last year\nand\nthe year before\n.
