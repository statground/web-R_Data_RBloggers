    "main_text": "Rugby Analytics with R: Complete Guide to Performance Analysis in Rugby Union and League\nPosted on\nJanuary 7, 2026\nby\nrprogrammingbooks\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nBlog - R Programming Books\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nRugby is a sport defined by collisions, structure, and constant tactical adaptation. Unlike many\nother invasion sports, rugby alternates between highly structured moments—scrums, lineouts,\nrestarts—and extended passages of chaotic open play. Each phase generates rich performance data:\ntackles, rucks, carries, kicks, meters gained, penalties conceded, turnovers, and spatial changes\nin territory. Despite this richness, rugby analytics has historically lagged behind other sports,\nespecially in terms of open, reproducible analytical workflows.\nThis gap presents a clear opportunity. R provides a complete environment for rugby performance\nanalysis: data acquisition, cleaning, modeling, visualization, and automated reporting. For\nanalysts, sports scientists, and coaches, R enables evidence-based decision-making that goes far\nbeyond traditional statistics and subjective video review.\nWhy rugby analytics requires a different analytical mindset\nRugby is not a possession-by-possession sport in the same way as basketball, nor a continuous-flow\ngame like football. Possession can be short or long, territory often matters more than time on the\nball, and a single penalty can flip match momentum. Analytics must therefore respect rugby’s\nunique structure.\nSimple totals—tackles, carries, meters—are insufficient on their own. Analysts must consider game\nstate, field position, opposition quality, and player role. R makes it possible to incorporate\nthis context systematically and consistently across matches and seasons.\nData acquisition in rugby: scraping, APIs, and internal feeds\nPublic rugby data is fragmented and inconsistent. Analysts often combine multiple sources to build\na usable dataset. R is particularly well suited to this challenge because it supports web scraping,\nAPI consumption, and database integration within a single workflow.\n# Core libraries for rugby data acquisition\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(httr)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n# Example: pulling match data from an API\nresponse <- GET(\"https://api.example.com/rugby/match/9876\")\nraw_json <- content(response, \"text\")\nmatch_data <- fromJSON(raw_json)\nWeb scraping is often necessary when APIs are unavailable. This requires careful handling of HTML\nstructure, rate limits, and data validation to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.\n# Scraping a match statistics table\npage <- read_html(\"https://example-rugby-site.com/match/9876\")\n\nteam_stats <- page %>%\n  html_node(\"table.match-stats\") %>%\n  html_table()\n\nteam_stats\nData cleaning and validation: a critical but underestimated step\nRugby datasets are rarely analysis-ready. Player substitutions, injury replacements, and data\nentry inconsistencies introduce errors that can distort results if left unchecked.\n# Standardizing and validating team statistics\nteam_stats_clean <- team_stats %>%\n  janitor::clean_names() %>%\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim)) %>%\n  mutate(\n    possession = as.numeric(possession),\n    territory = as.numeric(territory)\n  )\n\n# Basic validation check\nstopifnot(all(team_stats_clean$possession\nValidation logic should be embedded directly into the pipeline. This ensures that every new match\nis processed consistently, reducing human error and analyst workload.\nTransforming events into rugby-specific units of analysis\nRaw events are only the starting point. Meaningful rugby analysis requires transforming events\ninto units such as phases, possessions, sets, and passages of play.\n# Creating phase identifiers from ruck events\nevents <- events %>%\n  arrange(match_id, event_time) %>%\n  mutate(\n    phase_id = cumsum(event_type == \"ruck\")\n  )\n\n# Summarising phase-level performance\nphase_summary <- events %>%\n  group_by(match_id, team, phase_id) %>%\n  summarise(\n    duration = max(event_time) - min(event_time),\n    carries = sum(event_type == \"carry\"),\n    meters = sum(meters_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n    turnovers = sum(event_type == \"turnover\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\nThese structures allow analysts to study momentum, ruck efficiency, and attacking intent in a way\nthat aligns with how coaches understand the game.\nAdvanced player performance analysis with R\nPlayer evaluation in rugby must be contextual and role-specific. Front-row players, halves, and\noutside backs contribute in fundamentally different ways.\n# Player-level performance profile\nplayer_profile <- events %>%\n  group_by(player_id, player_name, position) %>%\n  summarise(\n    minutes_played = max(event_time) / 60,\n    tackles = sum(event_type == \"tackle\"),\n    missed_tackles = sum(event_type == \"missed_tackle\"),\n    carries = sum(event_type == \"carry\"),\n    meters = sum(meters_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n    offloads = sum(event_type == \"offload\"),\n    penalties_conceded = sum(event_type == \"penalty_conceded\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    tackles_per_min = tackles / minutes_played,\n    meters_per_carry = meters / carries\n  )\nRate-based metrics reveal impact more effectively than totals, especially when comparing starters\nto bench players or evaluating performance across different match contexts.\nDefensive systems analysis: beyond individual tackles\nEffective defense is systemic. Missed tackles often result from spacing errors, fatigue, or poor\ndecision-making rather than individual incompetence.\n# Defensive performance by field channel\ndefense_analysis <- events %>%\n  filter(event_type %in% c(\"tackle\", \"missed_tackle\")) %>%\n  group_by(team, field_channel) %>%\n  summarise(\n    tackles = sum(event_type == \"tackle\"),\n    misses = sum(event_type == \"missed_tackle\"),\n    success_rate = tackles / (tackles + misses),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\nDefensive analytics should highlight structural weaknesses and workload imbalances,\nnot just individual error counts.\nTerritory, kicking strategy, and spatial dominance\nTerritory remains a core determinant of success in rugby. Teams that consistently win the\nterritorial battle reduce defensive workload and increase scoring opportunities.\n# Kicking distance and efficiency\nkicks <- events %>%\n  filter(event_type == \"kick\") %>%\n  mutate(kick_distance = end_x - start_x)\n\nkicking_summary <- kicks %>%\n  group_by(team, kick_type) %>%\n  summarise(\n    avg_distance = mean(kick_distance, na.rm = TRUE),\n    kicks = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\nSpatial analysis allows analysts to quantify whether a team’s kicking strategy aligns with its\nstated game model and environmental constraints.\nWin probability and decision modeling in rugby\nWin probability models convert complex match states into intuitive probabilities. In rugby, these\nmodels must account for score, time, territory, possession, and discipline risk.\n# Building a basic win probability model\nwp_data <- matches %>%\n  mutate(\n    score_diff = team_score - opponent_score,\n    time_remaining = 80 - minute\n  )\n\nwp_model <- glm(\n  win ~ score_diff + time_remaining + territory,\n  data = wp_data,\n  family = binomial()\n)\n\nsummary(wp_model)\nEven simple models provide immediate value by framing tactical decisions—such as kicking for touch\nversus taking the points—in probabilistic terms.\nAutomated reporting and reproducible workflows\nThe final step in rugby analytics is communication. R enables analysts to automate reporting,\nensuring consistency and freeing time for deeper insight generation.\n# Creating a clean match summary table\nsummary_table <- team_stats_clean %>%\n  select(team, possession, territory, tackles, line_breaks, penalties_conceded)\n\nknitr::kable(summary_table)\nAutomated reports ensure that analysis becomes part of the weekly rhythm rather than an optional\nextra.\nThe strategic opportunity in rugby analytics with R\nThere is clear and growing interest in rugby analytics, but very little comprehensive, R-focused\ncontent. Analysts, sports scientists, and coaches are actively searching for practical guidance.\nA dedicated, end-to-end approach—covering data acquisition, performance metrics, modeling, and\nreporting—fills a genuine gap and establishes authority in a niche with minimal competition.\nMy book:\nRugby Analytics with R: Performance Analysis for Rugby Union & League\nA complete, practical guide for applying R to real-world rugby performance analysis, designed\nfor analysts, sports scientists, and coaches working in Rugby Union and Rugby League.\nThe post\nRugby Analytics with R: Complete Guide to Performance Analysis in Rugby Union and League\nappeared first on\nR Programming Books\n.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nBlog - R Programming Books\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
