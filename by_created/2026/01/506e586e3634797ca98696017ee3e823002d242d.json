(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nHappy New Year from the team at Jumping Rivers!\nAs we move through the midpoint of the 2020s, it’s a good time to\nreflect on the changes that we have seen so far in this decade. In the\nworld of data science nothing has dominated headlines quite like the\nrapid growth and uptake of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini have\nincredible potential to streamline day-to-day tasks, whether that’s\nprocessing vast amounts of information, providing a human-like chat\ninterface for customers or generating code. But they also come with\nnotable risks if not harnessed responsibly.\nAnyone that has interacted with these models is likely to have come\nacross\nhallucination\n, where the model confidently presents false\ninformation as though it is factually correct. This can happen for a\nvariety of reasons:\nLLMs often have no access to real-time information: how would a model\nthat was trained last year know today’s date?\nThe training data may be missing domain-specific information: can we\nreally trust an off-the-shelf model to have a good understanding of\npharmaceuticals and medicinal drugs?\nThe model may be over-eager to come across as intelligent, so it\ndecides to provide a confident output rather than a more nuanced,\nhonest answer.\nOften we need to give the model access to additional contextual\ninformation before we can make it “production-ready”. We can achieve\nthis using a\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nworkflow. In this\nblog post we will explore the steps involved and set up an example RAG\nworkflow using free and open source packages in R.\nWhat is RAG?\nIn a typical interaction with an LLM we have:\nA user prompt: the text that is submitted by the user.\nA response: the text that is returned by the LLM.\n(optional)\nA system prompt: additional instructions for how the LLM\nshould respond (for example,\n\"You respond in approximately 10 words or less\"\n).\nIn a RAG workflow we provide access to an external knowledge store which\ncan include text-based documents and webpages. Additional contextual\ninfo is then retrieved from the knowledge store (hence\n“retrieval”\n)\nand added to the user prompt before it is sent. In doing so we can\nexpect to receive a higher quality output.\nHow does it work?\nBefore going further, we must first introduce the concept of\nvectorisation\n.\nContrary to what you might believe, LLMs do not understand non-numerical\ntext! They are mathematical models, meaning they can only ingest and\noutput numerical vectors.\nSo how can a user interact with a model using plain English? The trick\nis that mappings exist which are able to convert between numerical\nvectors and text. These mappings are called “vector embeddings” and are\nused to convert the user prompt into a vector representation before it\nis passed to the LLM.\nSo, when setting up our RAG knowledge store, we have to store the\ninformation using a compatible vector representation. With this in mind,\nlet’s introduce a typical RAG workflow:\nContent\n: we decide which documents to include in the knowledge\nstore.\nExtraction\n: we extract the text from these documents in Markdown\nformat.\nChunking\n: the Markdown content is split into contextual “chunks”\n(for example, each section or subsection of a document might become\na chunk).\nVectorisation\n: the chunks are “vectorised” (i.e. we convert them\ninto a numerical vector representation).\nIndex\n: we create an index for our knowledge store which will be\nused to retrieve relevant chunks of information.\nRetrieval\n: we register the knowledge store with our model\ninterface. Now, when a user submits a prompt, it will be combined\nwith relevant chunks of information before it is ingested by the\nmodel.\nAt the retrieval step, a matching algorithm is typically used so that\nonly highly relevant chunks are retrieved from the knowledge store. In\nthis way, we are able to keep the size of the user prompts (and any\nincurred costs) to a minimum.\nSetting up a RAG workflow in R\nWe will make use of two packages which are available to install via the\nComprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)\n.\nBoth are actively maintained by\nPosit\n(formerly RStudio) and are free to install and use.\n{ragnar}\nThe\n{ragnar}\npackage provides functions\nfor extracting information from both text-based documents and webpages,\nand provides vector embeddings that are compatible with popular LLM\nproviders including OpenAI and Google.\nWe will use {ragnar} to build our knowledge store.\n{ellmer}\nThe\n{ellmer}\npackage allows us to\ninteract with a variety of LLM APIs from R. A complete list of supported\nmodel providers can be found in the\npackage\ndocumentation\n.\nNote that, while {ellmer} is free to install and use, you will still\nneed to set up an API token with your preferred model provider before\nyou can interact with any models. We will use the free Google Gemini\ntier for our example workflow. See the\nGemini API\ndocumentation\ncreating\nan API key, and the\n{ellmer}\ndocumentation\nfor authenticating with your API key from R.\nExample RAG workflow\nWe begin by loading the {ragnar} package.\nlibrary(\"ragnar\")\nThe URL provided below links to the\ntitle\npage\nof the “Efficient R\nProgramming” textbook, written by Robin Lovelace and our very own Colin\nGillespie. We’re going to use a couple of chapters from the book to\nconstruct a RAG knowledge store.\nurl = \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/\"\nLet’s use {ragnar} to read the contents of this page into a Markdown\nformat.\nmd = read_as_markdown(url)\nWe could vectorise this information as it is, but first we should split\nit up into contextual chunks.\nchunks = markdown_chunk(md)\nchunks\n#> # @document@origin: https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/\n#> # A tibble: 2 × 4\n#> start end context text \n#> * <int> <int> <chr> <chr> \n#> 1 1 1572 \"\" \"# Efficient R programmin…\n#> 2 597 2223 \"# Welcome to Efficient R Programming\" \"## Authors\\n\\n[Colin Gil…\nThe chunks are stored in a tibble format, with one row per chunk. The\ntext\ncolumn stores the chunk text (in the interests of saving space we\nhave only included the start of each chunk in the printed output above).\nThe title page has been split into two chunks and we can see that there\nis significant overlap (chunk 1 spans characters 1 to 1572 and chunk 2\nspans characters 597 to 2223). Overlapping chunks are perfectly normal\nand provides added context as to where each chunk sits relative to the\nother chunks.\nNote that you can visually inspect the chunks by running\nragnar_chunks_view(chunks)\n.\nIt’s time to build our knowledge store with a vector embedding that is\nappropriate for Google Gemini models.\n# Initialise a knowledge store with the Google Gemini embedding\nstore = ragnar_store_create(\n embed = embed_google_gemini()\n)\n\n# Insert the Markdown chunks\nragnar_store_insert(store, chunks)\nThe Markdown chunks are automatically converted into a vector\nrepresentation at the insertion step. It is important to use the\nappropriate vector embedding when we create the store. A knowledge store\ncreated using an OpenAI embedding will not be compatible with Google\nGemini models!\nBefore we can retrieve information from our store, we must create a\nstore index.\nragnar_store_build_index(store)\nWe can now test the retrieval capabilities of our knowledge store using\nthe\nragnar_retreive()\nfunction. For example, to retrieve any chunks\nrelevant to the text\nWho are the authors of “Efficient R\nProgramming”?\nwe can run:\nrelevant_knowledge = ragnar_retrieve(\n store,\n text = \"Who are the authors of \\\"Efficient R Programming\\\"?\"\n)\nrelevant_knowledge\n#> # A tibble: 1 × 9\n#> origin doc_id chunk_id start end cosine_distance bm25 context text \n#> <chr> <int> <list> <int> <int> <list> <lis> <chr> <chr>\n#> 1 https://csgi… 1 <int> 1 2223 <dbl [2]> <dbl> \"\" \"# E…\nNote that the\n\\\noperators in\n\\\"Efficient R Programming\\\"\nhave been\nused to print raw double quotes in the character string.\nWithout going into too much detail, the\ncosine_distance\nand\nbm25\ncolumns in the returned tibble provide information relating to the\nmatching algorithm used to identify the chunks. The other columns relate\nto the location and content of the chunks.\nFrom the output tibble we see that the full content of the title page\n(characters 1 to 2223) has been returned. This is because the original\ntwo chunks both contained information about the authors.\nLet’s add a more technical chapter from the textbook to the knowledge\nstore. The URL provided below links to\nChapter 7 (“Efficient\nOptimisation”)\n.\nLet’s add this to the knowledge store and rebuild the index.\nurl = \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/performance.html\"\n\n# Extract Markdown content and split into chunks\nchunks = url |>\n read_as_markdown() |>\n markdown_chunk()\n\n# Add the chunks to the knowledge store\nragnar_store_insert(store, chunks)\n\n# Rebuild the store index\nragnar_store_build_index(store)\nNow that our knowledge store includes content from both the title page\nand Chapter 7, let’s ask something more technical, like\nWhat are some\ngood practices for parallel computing in R?\n.\nrelevant_knowledge = ragnar_retrieve(\n store,\n text = \"What are some good practices for parallel computing in R?\"\n)\nrelevant_knowledge\n#> # A tibble: 4 × 9\n#> origin doc_id chunk_id start end cosine_distance bm25 context text \n#> <chr> <int> <list> <int> <int> <list> <lis> <chr> <chr>\n#> 1 https://csgi… 1 <int> 1 2223 <dbl [2]> <dbl> \"\" \"# E…\n#> 2 https://csgi… 2 <int> 1 1536 <dbl [1]> <dbl> \"\" \"# 7…\n#> 3 https://csgi… 2 <int> 22541 23995 <dbl [1]> <dbl> \"# 7 E… \"## …\n#> 4 https://csgi… 2 <int> 23996 26449 <dbl [2]> <dbl> \"# 7 E… \"The…\nFour chunks have been returned:\nOne chunk from the title page of the textbook.\nOne chunk from the start of Chapter 7.\nTwo chunks from\nSection 7.5 (“Parallel\nComputing”)\n.\nIt makes sense that we have chunks from Section 7.5, which appears to be\nhighly relevant to the question. By including the title page and the\nstart of Chapter 7, the LLM will also have access to useful metadata\nin case the user wants to find out where the model is getting its\ninformation from.\nNow that we have built and tested our retrieval tool, it’s time to\nconnect it up to a Gemini interface using {ellmer}. The code below will\ncreate a\nchat\nobject allowing us to send user prompts to Gemini.\nchat = ellmer::chat_google_gemini(\n system_prompt = \"You answer in approximately 10 words or less.\"\n)\nA system prompt has been included here to ensure a succinct response\nfrom the model API.\nWe can register this chat interface with our retrieval tool.\nragnar_register_tool_retrieve(chat, store)\nTo check if our RAG workflow has been set up correctly, let’s chat with\nthe model.\nchat$chat(\"What are some good practices for parallel computing in R?\")\n#> Use the `parallel` package, ensure you stop clusters with `stopCluster()` (or \n#> `on.exit()`), and utilize `parLapply()`, `parApply()`, or `parSapply()`.\nThe output looks plausible. Just to make sure, let’s check where the\nmodel found out this information.\nchat$chat(\"Where did you get that answer from?\")\n#> I retrieved the information from \"Efficient R programming\" by Colin Gillespie \n#> and Robin Lovelace.\nSuccess! The LLM has identified the name of the textbook and if we\nwanted to we could even ask about the specific chapter. A user\ninteracting with our model interface could now search online for this\ntextbook to fact-check the responses.\nIn the example workflow above, we manually selected a couple of chapters\nfrom the textbook to include in our knowledge store. It’s worth noting\nthat you can also use the\nragnar_find_links(url)\nfunction to retrieve\na list of links from a given webpage.\nDoing so for the title page will provide the links to all chapters.\nragnar_find_links(\"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/\")\n#> [1] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/\" \n#> [2] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/building-the-book-from-source.html\"\n#> [3] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/collaboration.html\" \n#> [4] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/data-carpentry.html\" \n#> [5] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/hardware.html\" \n#> [6] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html\" \n#> [7] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/input-output.html\" \n#> [8] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/introduction.html\" \n#> [9] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/learning.html\" \n#> [10] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/performance.html\" \n#> [11] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/preface.html\" \n#> [12] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/programming.html\" \n#> [13] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/references.html\" \n#> [14] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html\" \n#> [15] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html\"\nYou could then iterate through these links, extracting the contents from\neach webpage and inserting these into your RAG knowledge store. Just\nnote, however, that including additional information in your store will\nlikely increase the amount of text being sent to the model, which could\nraise costs. You should therefore think about what information is\nactually relevant for your LLM application.\nSummary\nIn summary, we have introduced the concept of retrieval-augmented\ngeneration for LLM-powered workflows and built an example workflow in R\nusing open source packages.\nBefore finishing, we are excited to announce that our new course\n“LLM-Driven Applications with R & Python” has just been added to our\ntraining portfolio.

It is important to use the\nappropriate vector embedding when we create the store. A knowledge store\ncreated using an OpenAI embedding will not be compatible with Google\nGemini models!</p>\n<p>Before we can retrieve information from our store, we must create a\nstore index.</p>\n<pre>ragnar_store_build_index(store)\n</pre><p>We can now test the retrieval capabilities of our knowledge store using\nthe <code>ragnar_retreive()</code> function. For example, to retrieve any chunks\nrelevant to the text <strong>Who are the authors of “Efficient R\nProgramming”?</strong> we can run:</p>\n<pre>relevant_knowledge = ragnar_retrieve(\n store,\n text = \"Who are the authors of \\\"Efficient R Programming\\\"?\"\n)\nrelevant_knowledge\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 9\n#&gt; origin doc_id chunk_id start end cosine_distance bm25 context text \n#&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;lis&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 https://csgi… 1 &lt;int&gt; 1 2223 &lt;dbl [2]&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; \"\" \"# E…\n</pre><p>Note that the <code>\\</code> operators in <code>\\\"Efficient R Programming\\\"</code> have been\nused to print raw double quotes in the character string.</p>\n<p>Without going into too much detail, the <code>cosine_distance</code> and <code>bm25</code>\ncolumns in the returned tibble provide information relating to the\nmatching algorithm used to identify the chunks. The other columns relate\nto the location and content of the chunks.</p>\n<p>From the output tibble we see that the full content of the title page\n(characters 1 to 2223) has been returned. This is because the original\ntwo chunks both contained information about the authors.</p>\n<p>Let’s add a more technical chapter from the textbook to the knowledge\nstore. The URL provided below links to <a href=\"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/performance.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7 (“Efficient\nOptimisation”)</a>.\nLet’s add this to the knowledge store and rebuild the index.</p>\n<pre>url = \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/performance.html\"\n\n# Extract Markdown content and split into chunks\nchunks = url |&gt;\n read_as_markdown() |&gt;\n markdown_chunk()\n\n# Add the chunks to the knowledge store\nragnar_store_insert(store, chunks)\n\n# Rebuild the store index\nragnar_store_build_index(store)\n</pre><p>Now that our knowledge store includes content from both the title page\nand Chapter 7, let’s ask something more technical, like <strong>What are some\ngood practices for parallel computing in R?</strong>.</p>\n<pre>relevant_knowledge = ragnar_retrieve(\n store,\n text = \"What are some good practices for parallel computing in R?\"\n)\nrelevant_knowledge\n#&gt; # A tibble: 4 × 9\n#&gt; origin doc_id chunk_id start end cosine_distance bm25 context text \n#&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;lis&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 https://csgi… 1 &lt;int&gt; 1 2223 &lt;dbl [2]&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; \"\" \"# E…\n#&gt; 2 https://csgi… 2 &lt;int&gt; 1 1536 &lt;dbl [1]&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; \"\" \"# 7…\n#&gt; 3 https://csgi… 2 &lt;int&gt; 22541 23995 &lt;dbl [1]&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; \"# 7 E… \"## …\n#&gt; 4 https://csgi… 2 &lt;int&gt; 23996 26449 &lt;dbl [2]&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; \"# 7 E… \"The…\n</pre><p>Four chunks have been returned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One chunk from the title page of the textbook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One chunk from the start of Chapter 7.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Two chunks from <a href=\"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/performance.html#performance-parallel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Section 7.5 (“Parallel\nComputing”)</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It makes sense that we have chunks from Section 7.5, which appears to be\nhighly relevant to the question. By including the title page and the\nstart of Chapter 7, the LLM will also have access to useful metadata\nin case the user wants to find out where the model is getting its\ninformation from.</p>\n<p>Now that we have built and tested our retrieval tool, it’s time to\nconnect it up to a Gemini interface using {ellmer}. The code below will\ncreate a <code>chat</code> object allowing us to send user prompts to Gemini.</p>\n<pre>chat = ellmer::chat_google_gemini(\n system_prompt = \"You answer in approximately 10 words or less.\"\n)\n</pre><p>A system prompt has been included here to ensure a succinct response\nfrom the model API.</p>\n<p>We can register this chat interface with our retrieval tool.</p>\n<pre>ragnar_register_tool_retrieve(chat, store)\n</pre><p>To check if our RAG workflow has been set up correctly, let’s chat with\nthe model.</p>\n<pre>chat$chat(\"What are some good practices for parallel computing in R?\")\n#&gt; Use the `parallel` package, ensure you stop clusters with `stopCluster()` (or \n#&gt; `on.exit()`), and utilize `parLapply()`, `parApply()`, or `parSapply()`.\n</pre><p>The output looks plausible. Just to make sure, let’s check where the\nmodel found out this information.</p>\n<pre>chat$chat(\"Where did you get that answer from?\")\n#&gt; I retrieved the information from \"Efficient R programming\" by Colin Gillespie \n#&gt; and Robin Lovelace.\n</pre><p>Success! The LLM has identified the name of the textbook and if we\nwanted to we could even ask about the specific chapter. A user\ninteracting with our model interface could now search online for this\ntextbook to fact-check the responses.</p>\n<p>In the example workflow above, we manually selected a couple of chapters\nfrom the textbook to include in our knowledge store. It’s worth noting\nthat you can also use the <code>ragnar_find_links(url)</code> function to retrieve\na list of links from a given webpage.</p>\n<p>Doing so for the title page will provide the links to all chapters.</p>\n<pre>ragnar_find_links(\"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/\")\n#&gt; [1] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/\" \n#&gt; [2] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/building-the-book-from-source.html\"\n#&gt; [3] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/collaboration.html\" \n#&gt; [4] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/data-carpentry.html\" \n#&gt; [5] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/hardware.html\" \n#&gt; [6] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html\" \n#&gt; [7] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/input-output.html\" \n#&gt; [8] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/introduction.html\" \n#&gt; [9] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/learning.html\" \n#&gt; [10] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/performance.html\" \n#&gt; [11] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/preface.html\" \n#&gt; [12] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/programming.html\" \n#&gt; [13] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/references.html\" \n#&gt; [14] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html\" \n#&gt; [15] \"https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/workflow.html\"\n</pre><p>You could then iterate through these links, extracting the contents from\neach webpage and inserting these into your RAG knowledge store. Just\nnote, however, that including additional information in your store will\nlikely increase the amount of text being sent to the model, which could\nraise costs. You should therefore think about what information is\nactually relevant for your LLM application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>In summary, we have introduced the concept of retrieval-augmented\ngeneration for LLM-powered workflows and built an example workflow in R\nusing open source packages.</p>\n<p>Before finishing, we are excited to announce that our new course\n“LLM-Driven Applications with R &amp; Python” has just been added to our\ntraining portfolio.
