    "main_text": "GOLD/SILVER RATIO: GenAI with Quant Agents on Microsoft AI Foundry\nPosted on\nJanuary 13, 2026\nby\nSelcuk Disci\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nDataGeeek\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\n1. Introduction: The Strategic Edge of Agentic Finance\nIn the contemporary landscape of quantitative finance, the bottleneck is no longer data availability, but the speed of insight generation. Leveraging the\nMicrosoft AI Foundry\necosystem, we have moved beyond static scripting into the realm of\nAutonomous Financial Agents\n. This article explores how a specialized agent can navigate precious metal volatility by analyzing the Gold/Silver ratio with high-performance precision.\n2. Infrastructure: Model Deployment on Microsoft AI Foundry\nThe intelligence behind this analysis is not a local script but a\ndeployed model instance\non Microsoft AI Foundry. We utilize the\nGPT-4o\nmodel, deployed as a scalable web service within the Foundry environment.\nEndpoint Security:\nBy using the Azure OpenAI service within AI Foundry, we ensure that financial queries and data remain within a secure, enterprise-grade perimeter.\nAgentic Logic:\nThe “Agent” is more than just a model; it is a programmed entity with a specific\nSystem Prompt\nthat defines its persona as a Quantitative Researcher. This allows the model to “reason” through the necessary steps: from library loading to data merging and final visualization.\n3. The Technical Bridge: Python-R Integration\nOne of the most powerful features of our AI Foundry Agent is its multi-lingual capability. It bridges the gap between Python and R using the\nrpy2\nlibrary, creating a high-performance research pipeline.\nThe R Ecosystem in Play:\ntidyquant\n&\ntimetk\n: These packages are the engine for our time-series analysis.\ntidyquant\nhandles the seamless fetching of\nGC=F\nand\nSI=F\ndata, while\ntimetk\nmanages the complex task of plotting with built-in smoothing algorithms.\ndplyr\n&\nlubridate\n: Essential for the “tidy” manipulation of data, allowing the Agent to perform\ninner_join\noperations and date-based filtering with surgical precision.\n4. Methodology: Taming the Noise with Visual Precision\nTo extract actionable trends, the Agent is instructed to apply a\nLOESS smoothing algorithm\n. By strictly setting\n.line_size = 1.5\nand\n.smooth_size = 1.5\n, we ensure the trendline is bold enough to be the primary focus for analysts, effectively “taming” the daily price volatility.\n5. Conclusion: Scaling Quantitative Research\nThe synergy between\nMicrosoft AI Foundry\n,\ndeployed LLMs\n, and specialized\nR packages\nrepresents the future of financial research. We have replaced manual data wrangling with an autonomous, standardized agent that can be scaled across thousands of different asset pairs with a single command.\nThe ABI Connection (Bridging Python to R in VS Code)\nFor the script to run locally in\nVS Code\n, we must establish a robust\nApplication Binary Interface (ABI)\nconnection. This is handled by the\nrpy2\nlibrary, which serves as the translation layer between Python and the R interpreter.\nSynchronization:\nThe script uses a\nlocalconverter\nto transform Python data types into R objects in real-time.\nEnvironment Sync:\nBefore the Agent’s code is executed, the script automatically synchronizes the working directory (\nsetwd\n) so that files generated by R (like the\nratio_plot.png\n) are immediately accessible to the Python environment for rendering.\nimport os\n\n# Force rpy2 to use ABI mode to avoid the Windows CFFI conflict\nos.environ['RPY2_CFFI_MODE'] = 'ABI'\n\nimport rpy2.robjects as robjects\nfrom rpy2.robjects.packages import importr\nprint(\"Interface initialized in ABI mode.\")\nThe Integrated Agent Script\n:\nimport os\nimport httpx\nfrom openai import AzureOpenAI\nimport rpy2.robjects as robjects\nfrom rpy2.robjects import pandas2ri\nfrom rpy2.robjects.conversion import localconverter\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\n\n#Microsoft AI Foundry - Azure OpenAI Connection\nclient = AzureOpenAI(\n    api_version=\"2024-12-01-preview\",\n    azure_endpoint=\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\",\n    api_key=\"AZURE_OPENAI_KEY\", \n    http_client=httpx.Client(verify=False, trust_env=False)\n)\n\ndef run_updated_agent(user_request):\n    system_instructions = (\n        \"You are a Quantitative Researcher.
