It's not even AI (see e.g https://github.com/Techtonique/techtonique-r-pkgs). \n\nTypically, since submitting this package to your highest authority, I've shipped ~5 packages to PyPI (within minutes, and they also check if the code is malicious, or it will be removed) without being bothered by gatekeeping (\"this comma is missing\", \"oh english grammar requires a full stop there\"). And this is not an insult, it's food for thought (if you're humble enough to accept it), when Python is eating R at breakfast everyday. \n\nR seems to be stuck somewhere in a very distant past with discussions like this.\nThat’s the comment of a\nfoolish\nguy. If that is\nfoolishness\n, I want to be\nfoolish\nforever.\nThe package,\nunifiedml\n, provides a consistent interface for machine learning in R, making it easier to work with different ML algorithms using a unified API.\nWhy\nunifiedml\n?\nR has an incredibly rich ecosystem of machine learning packages, but each comes with its own syntax and conventions.\nunifiedml\nis an effort to bridge this gap by providing:\nExtremely lightweight (see for yourself:\nhttps://github.com/Techtonique/unifiedml/blob/main/R/model.R\n) and consistent API across different ML algorithms\nAutomatic task detection (regression vs classification)\nBuilt-in cross-validation with appropriate metrics\nModel interpretation tools including feature importance and partial dependence plots\nSeamless integration with existing R packages (once installed) like glmnet, randomForest, and more\nInstallation\ninstall.packages(\"unifiedml\", repos = \"https://cran.r-project.org/\")\n\nlibrary(unifiedml)\nQuick Start: Regression Example\nHere’s how easy it is to build a regression model:\nlibrary(glmnet)\ndata(mtcars)\n\n# Prepare data\nX <- as.matrix(mtcars[, -1])\ny <- mtcars$mpg  # numeric → automatic regression\n\n# Fit model\nmod <- Model$new(glmnet::glmnet)\nmod$fit(X, y, alpha = 0, lambda = 0.1)\n\n# Make predictions\npredictions <- mod$predict(X)\n\n# Get model summary with feature importance\nmod$summary()\n\n# Visualize partial dependence\nmod$plot(feature = 1)\n\n# Cross-validation (automatically uses RMSE for regression)\ncv_scores <- cross_val_score(mod, X, y, cv = 5)\ncat(\"Mean RMSE:\", mean(cv_scores), \"\\n\")\nQuick Start: Classification Example\nThe same intuitive API works for classification:\nlibrary(randomForest)\n\ndata(iris)\n\n# Prepare data\nX <- as.matrix(iris[, 1:4])\ny <- iris$Species  # factor → automatic classification\n\n# Fit model\nmod <- Model$new(randomForest::randomForest)\nmod$fit(X, y, ntree = 100)\n\n# Make predictions\npredictions <- mod$predict(X)\n\n# Cross-validation (automatically uses accuracy for classification)\ncv_scores <- cross_val_score(mod, X, y, cv = 5)\ncat(\"Mean Accuracy:\", mean(cv_scores), \"\\n\")\nKey Features\nConsistent Interface\nWhether you’re using glmnet, randomForest, xgboost, or any other compatible algorithm, the interface remains the same. This makes it easy to:\nSwitch between algorithms\nCompare model performance\nBuild reproducible workflows\nAutomatic Task Detection\nNo need to specify whether you’re doing regression or classification—unifiedml automatically detects this based on your target variable type.\nModel Interpretation (in progress)\nBuilt-in tools for understanding your models:\nFeature importance rankings\nPartial dependence plots\nComprehensive model summaries\nNote\nunifiedml\nis still very young, so there\nmight\nbe some rough edges.
