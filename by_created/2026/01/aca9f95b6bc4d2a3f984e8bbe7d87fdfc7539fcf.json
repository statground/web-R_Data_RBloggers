  "meta_description": "Read it in: Español. Maintaining an open source package is rewarding work, but it’s also a lot of work. Life and careers change, interests shift, and sometimes you simply don’t have the time or energy to keep working on your R package (and that’s okay!1). When that happens, one of the most responsible things you can do for package users, and for yourself, is to proactively look for a new maintainer or co-maintainer. ‘How do I recruit a new maintainer?’ is a question we hear a lot at rOpenSci. Over the years, we’ve supported rOpenSci’s package authors through this transition, helping them connect with potential maintainers, clarify expectations around the role, and make handovers smoother and more sustainable. In this post, we share practical tips and strategies to help you find people that can contribute and eventually take over your package, based on what we have learned through supporting maintainers of packages that are part of the rOpenSci suite. Start early The best time to start looking for a new maintainer is well before you actually need one, and the best place to look for a new maintainer is among existing contributors to your package. For this reason, it’s a good idea to make planning for succession part of your package design and maintenance strategy from the beginning. We encourage package authors to write a “life cycle statement” to describe your medium- to long-term vision of package development maintenance. This can be just a few sentences in a CONTRIBUTING.md or README.md file that outlines your intentions for development, including how long you anticipate maintaining the package. Even if the future is uncertain, this helps set expectations for yourself as well as potential contributors. Make the package contributor-friendly If you want to attract contributors who can become maintainers in the short- or long-term, your package needs to be approachable. Our Dev Guide has an entire chapter on making packages contributor-friendly and we also have a Community Call “Set Up Your Package to Foster a Community”. Essentially, here are some key points to consider. Ask yourself: Could a new person understand how to build, test, and release this package from your repo alone? Is there enough documentation to make contributing clear and friendly? Adding or improving contributing guidelines is a great way to lower barriers to someone starting to act like a maintainer, even before they officially take on the role. A good CONTRIBUTING.md can cover: How to set up a development environment. Workflow preferences: Issue before a Pull Request? How you prefer to receive PRs (e.g., one feature per Pull Request, must include tests, etc.). Code style or formatting guidelines. Any tests and how to run them. Any release process notes, including scripts, CI workflows, or manual steps you take to release a new version. The more you have documented clearly, the less hard it will feel for someone to say “yes” to maintaining. Depending on your ability to do so, you can also actively invest in growing contributors in a number of ways, for example: Mentor a beginning contributor through their first pull request2. Host a “bug bash” or “documentation sprint” to encourage contributions. Our guide on organizing events for first-time contributors has resources to help you plan. Highlight “good first issues” and “help wanted issues” in your issue tracker. These activities help expand your community of contributors and potential future maintainers, but will be most effective if you start well ahead of package handover, when you still have plenty of time and energy to invest. Clarify what you’re willing (and not willing) to do Potential new maintainers will wonder: Will you still be around for questions? Will you keep some level of control, or are you fully handing over? (i.e. are you looking for a co-maintainer or a new maintainer? Be explicit. For example: “I’ll help out and will be available during the transition, but plan to fully remove myself as maintainer once the transition is complete.” “I’m fully handing over maintenance but am happy to answer a few questions during the transition.” “I’d like to hand over fully and remove myself as maintainer as soon as possible.” Setting clear boundaries helps others decide whether to volunteer and prevents misunderstandings later. Open an issue: “Seeking New Maintainer” Once you’ve decided to look for new maintainers or co-maintainers, and how you plan to be involve with the project in the future, communicate that clearly. A visible first step is to open an issue in your repository dedicated to this topic. Create an issue with a clear title, such as: “Seeking new maintainer(s)”, “New maintainer wanted”, “New co-maintainer(s) welcome” or “Looking for co-maintainers”. In the body, you can include: What level of maintenance is needed (bug fixes only, feature development, documentation, etc.). What you’re looking for in a new contributor/co-maintainer: Familiarity with the language/ecosystem? Experience with testing or CI? Comfort with releasing new versions? How to express interest (comment on the issue, email you, etc.). Any timeline you have in mind for the transition. Optionally you can also explain Why you’re stepping back (at a high level: time, interest, job change, etc.). This issue becomes the central place to discuss ownership changes and can later serve as a public record of the transition. The rentrez package “New Maintainer(s)” issue is a good example of content, resources and followup conversation. If your repo is on GitHub you can pin this issue and it will be shown at the top of the Issues tab, making it more visible to visitors. Update your README to reflect the package’s status The README is the other place that many users will see. Add a short, highly visible note near the top, for example: ⚠️ **Project status:** we are looking for a new maintainer. If you're interested in helping maintain this package, please see [this issue](link-to-issue) or get in touch at your_email@example.com. This message will: Sets expectations for users. Invites potential maintainers directly from your repo front page. It reduces the chance that someone assumes the package is abandoned without explanation (this blog post list the sources of information we advise people to check to understand package status). You can also add a “Project Status” section in the README that gives a bit more context (e.g., “maintenance mode,” “new features unlikely without new maintainers,” etc.). Reach out to existing contributors and power users The best candidates for new maintainers are often already nearby: People who have submitted PRs. People who have filed useful, detailed issues. People you know use the package in their work. You can: Send a short, polite email or message to a few people who have been especially active. Even if they say no, they may know someone else who would be a good fit. If you don’t have an email or other way of contact then tag contributors directly in the “Seeking new maintainer” issue, like the rentrez package maintainer did. Announce it where your users are Now that your package repo has clear messages and a place to express interest and a clear way of communicate with you, is a good idea to spread the word beyond your repo. Consider posting a brief announcement in places where your users or contributors are likely to see it: Community forums, mailing lists, Slack/Discord channels relevant to your language/ecosystem. Social media (e.g., Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn) using specific hashtags like #RStats. For example, rOpenSci lists “New maintainers” issues in our website, we share them on our social media and in our newsletter. Add a package startup message At certain point, you can consider adding a startup message that informs users about the maintainer search. In this message you can link to the “Seeking new maintainer” issue and encourage users to check it out if they’re interested in helping. This is an aggressive move and may annoy some users, so consider it only if your package has a lot of active users and you haven’t had much luck finding a new maintainer through other channels. Last resort: archive your package If after a reasonable amount of time you were not able to find a new maintainer for your package, you might have to make the difficult decision to archive it, on your code forge, e.g. GitHub – and CRAN if relevant. Archiving the package puts an, albeit sad, end on your maintenance efforts. Before archiving your package, take time to add an explanatory comment in all issues and PRs and to close them all. You can create a new README to explain the new status. You could add how to get in touch with you in case someone would like to revive the repository and take on maintenance. Maybe your software will be replaced by other packages, maybe someone will end up reaching out to you to request you transfer the repository to them, maybe someone will create a replacement with the same name (and hopefully correct authorship and licensing if they reuse your code). In all cases, you will have done your best and the fate of the R package is out of your hands. It’s okay to step back Stepping down from maintaining a package is a normal part of the open source life cycle. By: Make plans for succession from the beginning, Making the package contributor-friendly, Clarifying your own boundaries, Opening a clear “Seeking new maintainer” issue, Updating your README, Reaching out to contributors, Announcing the search in the right channels, and if needed, archiving your package, you give your project the best chance to continue, while also respecting your own time and energy. Do you have any other tips or ideas? Please share them. We would love to know! If you feel guilty, remember that all your hard work up until now isn’t negated by taking a step back in future. ↩︎ This can be a great way to discover if you contributing guide is sufficiently detailed. ↩︎",

What you’re looking for in a new contributor/co-maintainer: Familiarity with the language/ecosystem? Experience with testing or CI? Comfort with releasing new versions? How to express interest (comment on the issue, email you, etc.). Any timeline you have in mind for the transition. Optionally you can also explain Why you’re stepping back (at a high level: time, interest, job change, etc.). This issue becomes the central place to discuss ownership changes and can later serve as a public record of the transition. The rentrez package “New Maintainer(s)” issue is a good example of content, resources and followup conversation. If your repo is on GitHub you can pin this issue and it will be shown at the top of the Issues tab, making it more visible to visitors. Update your README to reflect the package’s status The README is the other place that many users will see. Add a short, highly visible note near the top, for example: ⚠️ **Project status:** we are looking for a new maintainer. If you're interested in helping maintain this package, please see [this issue](link-to-issue) or get in touch at your_email@example.com. This message will: Sets expectations for users. Invites potential maintainers directly from your repo front page. It reduces the chance that someone assumes the package is abandoned without explanation (this blog post list the sources of information we advise people to check to understand package status). You can also add a “Project Status” section in the README that gives a bit more context (e.g., “maintenance mode,” “new features unlikely without new maintainers,” etc.). Reach out to existing contributors and power users The best candidates for new maintainers are often already nearby: People who have submitted PRs. People who have filed useful, detailed issues. People you know use the package in their work. You can: Send a short, polite email or message to a few people who have been especially active. Even if they say no, they may know someone else who would be a good fit. If you don’t have an email or other way of contact then tag contributors directly in the “Seeking new maintainer” issue, like the rentrez package maintainer did. Announce it where your users are Now that your package repo has clear messages and a place to express interest and a clear way of communicate with you, is a good idea to spread the word beyond your repo. Consider posting a brief announcement in places where your users or contributors are likely to see it: Community forums, mailing lists, Slack/Discord channels relevant to your language/ecosystem. Social media (e.g., Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn) using specific hashtags like #RStats. For example, rOpenSci lists “New maintainers” issues in our website, we share them on our social media and in our newsletter. Add a package startup message At certain point, you can consider adding a startup message that informs users about the maintainer search. In this message you can link to the “Seeking new maintainer” issue and encourage users to check it out if they’re interested in helping. This is an aggressive move and may annoy some users, so consider it only if your package has a lot of active users and you haven’t had much luck finding a new maintainer through other channels. Last resort: archive your package If after a reasonable amount of time you were not able to find a new maintainer for your package, you might have to make the difficult decision to archive it, on your code forge, e.g. GitHub – and CRAN if relevant. Archiving the package puts an, albeit sad, end on your maintenance efforts. Before archiving your package, take time to add an explanatory comment in all issues and PRs and to close them all. You can create a new README to explain the new status. You could add how to get in touch with you in case someone would like to revive the repository and take on maintenance. Maybe your software will be replaced by other packages, maybe someone will end up reaching out to you to request you transfer the repository to them, maybe someone will create a replacement with the same name (and hopefully correct authorship and licensing if they reuse your code). In all cases, you will have done your best and the fate of the R package is out of your hands. It’s okay to step back Stepping down from maintaining a package is a normal part of the open source life cycle. By: Make plans for succession from the beginning, Making the package contributor-friendly, Clarifying your own boundaries, Opening a clear “Seeking new maintainer” issue, Updating your README, Reaching out to contributors, Announcing the search in the right channels, and if needed, archiving your package, you give your project the best chance to continue, while also respecting your own time and energy. Do you have any other tips or ideas? Please share them. We would love to know! If you feel guilty, remember that all your hard work up until now isn’t negated by taking a step back in future. ↩︎ This can be a great way to discover if you contributing guide is sufficiently detailed. ↩︎",

Essentially, here are some key points to consider.\nAsk yourself:\nCould a new person understand how to build, test, and release this package from your repo alone?\nIs there enough documentation to make contributing clear and friendly?\nAdding or improving contributing guidelines is a great way to lower barriers to someone starting to act like a maintainer, even before they officially take on the role.\nA good\nCONTRIBUTING.md\ncan cover:\nHow to set up a development environment.\nWorkflow preferences: Issue before a Pull Request?\nHow you prefer to receive PRs (e.g., one feature per Pull Request, must include tests, etc.).\nCode style or formatting guidelines.\nAny tests and how to run them.\nAny release process notes, including scripts, CI workflows, or manual steps you take to release a new version.\nThe more you have documented clearly, the less hard it will feel for someone to say “yes” to maintaining.\nDepending on your ability to do so, you can also actively invest in growing contributors in a number of ways, for example:\nMentor a beginning contributor through their first pull request\n2\n.\nHost a “bug bash” or “documentation sprint” to encourage contributions. Our\nguide on organizing events for first-time contributors\nhas resources to help you plan.\nHighlight “good first issues” and\n“help wanted issues”\nin your issue tracker.\nThese activities help expand your community of contributors and potential future maintainers, but will be most effective if you start well ahead of package handover, when you still have plenty of time and energy to invest.\nClarify what you’re willing (and not willing) to do\nPotential new maintainers will wonder:\nWill you still be around for questions?\nWill you keep some level of control, or are you fully handing over? (i.e. are you looking for a\nco-maintainer\nor a new\nmaintainer\n?\nBe explicit.\nFor example:\n“I’ll help out and will be available during the transition, but plan to fully remove myself as maintainer once the transition is complete.”\n“I’m fully handing over maintenance but am happy to answer a few questions during the transition.”\n“I’d like to hand over fully and remove myself as maintainer as soon as possible.”\nSetting clear boundaries helps others decide whether to volunteer and prevents misunderstandings later.\nOpen an issue: “Seeking New Maintainer”\nOnce you’ve decided to look for new maintainers or co-maintainers, and how you plan to be involve with the project in the future, communicate that clearly.\nA visible first step is to open an issue in your repository dedicated to this topic.\nCreate an issue with a clear title, such as: “Seeking new maintainer(s)”, “New maintainer wanted”, “New co-maintainer(s) welcome” or “Looking for co-maintainers”.\nIn the body, you can include:\nWhat level of maintenance\nis needed (bug fixes only, feature development, documentation, etc.).\nWhat you’re looking for\nin a new contributor/co-maintainer:\nFamiliarity with the language/ecosystem?\nExperience with testing or CI?\nComfort with releasing new versions?\nHow to express interest\n(comment on the issue, email you, etc.).\nAny\ntimeline\nyou have in mind for the transition.\nOptionally you can also explain\nWhy\nyou’re stepping back (at a high level: time, interest, job change, etc.).\nThis issue becomes the central place to discuss ownership changes and can later serve as a public record of the transition.\nThe rentrez package “New Maintainer(s)” issue\nis a good example of content, resources and followup conversation.\nIf your repo is on GitHub you can\npin\nthis issue and it will be shown at the top of the Issues tab, making it more visible to visitors.\nUpdate your README to reflect the package’s status\nThe README is the other place that many users will see.\nAdd a short, highly visible note near the top, for example:\n⚠️ **Project status:** we are looking for a new maintainer.\nIf you're interested in helping maintain this package,\nplease see [this issue](link-to-issue) or\nget in touch at\n[email protected]\n.\nThis message will:\nSets expectations for users.\nInvites potential maintainers directly from your repo front page.\nIt reduces the chance that someone assumes the package is abandoned without explanation (\nthis blog post list the sources of information we advise people to check to understand package status\n).\nYou can also add a\n“Project Status”\nsection in the README that gives a bit more context (e.g., “maintenance mode,” “new features unlikely without new maintainers,” etc.).\nReach out to existing contributors and power users\nThe best candidates for new maintainers are often already nearby:\nPeople who have submitted PRs.\nPeople who have filed useful, detailed issues.\nPeople you know use the package in their work.\nYou can:\nSend a short, polite email or message to a few people who have been especially active.

Even if they say no, they may know someone else who would be a good fit.</li>\n<li>If you don’t have an email or other way of contact then tag contributors directly in the “Seeking new maintainer” issue, like the <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/rentrez/issues/203\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">rentrez package maintainer did</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nAnnounce it where your users are\n</h2><p>Now that your package repo has clear messages and a place to express interest and a clear way of communicate with you, is a good idea to spread the word beyond your repo.</p>\n<p>Consider posting a brief announcement in places where your users or contributors are likely to see it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Community forums, mailing lists, Slack/Discord channels relevant to your language/ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Social media (e.g., Mastodon, Bluesky, LinkedIn) using specific hashtags like #RStats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, rOpenSci <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/help-wanted/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lists “New maintainers” issues in our website</a>, we share them on our social media and in our <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2025/12/18/news-december-2025/#calls-for-contributions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter</a>.</p>\n<h2>\nAdd a package startup message\n</h2><p>At certain point, you can consider adding a startup message that informs users about the maintainer search.</p>\n<p>In this message you can link to the “Seeking new maintainer” issue and encourage users to check it out if they’re interested in helping.</p>\n<p>This is an aggressive move and may annoy some users, so consider it only if your package has a lot of active users and you haven’t had much luck finding a new maintainer through other channels.</p>\n<h2>\nLast resort: archive your package\n</h2><p>If after a reasonable amount of time you were not able to find a new maintainer for your package,\nyou might have to make the difficult decision to archive it, on your code forge, e.g. <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> – and CRAN if relevant.\nArchiving the package puts an, albeit sad, end on your maintenance efforts.</p>\n<p>Before archiving your package, take time to add an explanatory comment in all issues and PRs and to close them all.\nYou can create a new README to explain the new status.\nYou could add how to get in touch with you in case someone would like to revive the repository and take on maintenance.</p>\n<p>Maybe your software will be replaced by other packages,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/nodbi/issues/48\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">maybe someone will end up reaching out to you to request you transfer the repository to them</a>,\nmaybe someone will create a replacement with the same name (and hopefully correct authorship and licensing if they reuse your code).\nIn all cases, you will have done your best and the fate of the R package is out of your hands.</p>\n<h2>\nIt’s okay to step back\n</h2><p>Stepping down from maintaining a package is a normal part of the open source life cycle.</p>\n<p>By:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make plans for succession from the beginning,</li>\n<li>Making the package contributor-friendly,</li>\n<li>Clarifying your own boundaries,</li>\n<li>Opening a clear “Seeking new maintainer” issue,</li>\n<li>Updating your README,</li>\n<li>Reaching out to contributors,</li>\n<li>Announcing the search in the right channels,</li>\n<li>and if needed, archiving your package,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>you give your project the best chance to continue, while also respecting your own time and energy.</p>\n<p>Do you have any other tips or ideas?\nPlease share them.\nWe would love to know!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>If you feel guilty, remember that all your hard work up until now isn’t negated by taking a step back in future. <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2026/01/27/new-maintainer/#fnref:1\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-backlink\" target=\"_blank\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>This can be a great way to discover if you contributing guide is sufficiently detailed. <a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2026/01/27/new-maintainer/#fnref:2\" rel=\"nofollow\" role=\"doc-backlink\" target=\"_blank\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"jp-relatedposts\" id=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related</em></h3>\n</div>\n<!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 4.0.47-->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid;
