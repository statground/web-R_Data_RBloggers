    "main_text": "Why Submit to AI in Production: Speaking as a Tool for Better Work\nPosted on\nJanuary 20, 2026\nby\nThe Jumping Rivers Blog\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nThe Jumping Rivers Blog\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nWe’re accepting abstracts for AI in Production until\n23rd January\n. The conference takes place on\n4th–5th June 2026\nin Newcastle, with talks on Friday 5th across two streams: one focused on engineering and production systems, the other on machine learning and model development.\nWe often hear: “My work isn’t ready to talk about yet” or “I’m not sure anyone would be interested.” We want to address that hesitation directly.\nSpeaking at a conference isn’t primarily about promoting yourself or your organisation.\nIt’s a practical tool that helps you do better work. Preparing and delivering a talk forces useful reflection, invites feedback from people facing similar challenges, and turns knowledge that lives only in your head into something your team can reuse.\nIf you’re wondering whether your work qualifies: internal systems count, work in progress counts, partial success counts.\nSubmit your abstract by\n23rd January\non the AI in Production website.\nPreparing a Talk Clarifies Your Decisions\nWhen you sit down to explain a technical choice to an audience, you have to answer questions you might have glossed over at the time: Why did we build it this way? What constraints shaped our approach? What would we do differently now?\nThis isn’t about justifying your decisions to others. It’s about understanding them yourself. The process of turning a production system into a coherent narrative forces you to see patterns you were too close to notice while building it. You identify what worked, what didn’t, and why. That clarity is valuable whether or not you ever give the talk.\nMany practitioners find that writing an abstract or outline reveals gaps in their thinking. A deployment strategy that seemed obvious in context becomes harder to explain without it. A monitoring approach that felt pragmatic reveals underlying assumptions. This friction is useful. It means you’re learning something about your own work.\nSpeaking Invites Useful Feedback\nThe audience at AI in Production will broadly fall across two streams: engineering (building, shipping, maintaining, and scaling systems) and machine learning (model development, evaluation, and applied ML).\nWhether you’re working on infrastructure and deployment or on training pipelines and model behaviour, you’ll be in a room with people facing similar constraints: limited resources, shifting requirements, imperfect data, and operational pressures.\nWhen you share what you’ve tried, you get feedback from people who understand the context. Someone has solved a similar problem differently. Someone has run into the same failure mode. Someone asks a question that makes you reconsider an assumption.\nThis kind of peer feedback is hard to get otherwise. Your team is too close to the work. Online discussions lack context. A conference talk puts your approach in front of people who can offer informed perspectives without having to understand your entire stack or organisational structure first.\nTalks Help Share Responsibility and Knowledge\nIn many teams, knowledge about production systems sits with one or two people. They know why certain decisions were made, where the edge cases are, and how to interpret the monitoring dashboards. That concentration of knowledge creates risk.\nPreparing a talk is a forcing function for documentation. To explain your system to strangers, you have to articulate what’s currently tacit. That articulation becomes something your team can use: onboarding material, decision records, runbooks.\nSpeaking also distributes responsibility. When you present work publicly, it stops being just yours. Your team shares ownership of the ideas. Others can critique, extend, or maintain them. This is particularly valuable for platform teams or infrastructure work, where the people who built something may not be the ones operating it six months later.\nTurning Tacit Knowledge into Reusable Material\nMuch of what you know about your production systems isn’t written down. You understand the failure modes, the workarounds, and the operational quirks. You know which metrics matter and which are noise. You remember why you made certain tradeoffs.\nA conference talk is an excuse to capture that knowledge. The slides become a reference. The abstract becomes a design document. The Q&A reveals what wasn’t clear and needs better documentation.\nEven if the talk itself is ephemeral, the process of preparing it leaves artefacts. You’ve already done the hard work of running the system. Speaking about it turns that experience into something others can learn from, and you can build on.\nYour Work Is Worth Sharing\nIf you’re maintaining AI systems in production, you’re solving problems worth talking about. Making models reliable under load, keeping training pipelines maintainable, monitoring behaviour when ground truth is delayed or absent, and managing technical debt while shipping features.\nThese are the problems practitioners face every day. Your approach won’t be perfect, and that’s the point. Talks about work in progress, about things that didn’t work, about compromises made under constraint are often more useful than polished success stories.\nWe’re looking for honest accounts of how people are actually building and operating AI systems. That might fit the engineering stream (deployment, infrastructure, monitoring, scaling) or the machine learning stream (training, evaluation, model behaviour, responsible data use). If you’re doing work in either area, you have something to contribute.\nSubmit an Abstract\nThe deadline is\n23rd January\n. You’ll need a title and an abstract of up to 250 words. You don’t need a perfect story or a finished project. You need a problem you’ve worked on, some approaches you’ve tried, and some lessons you’ve learned.\nThink about what would be useful for someone six months behind you on a similar path. Think about what you wish someone had told you before you started. Think about the conversation you’d want to have with peers who understand the constraints you’re working under.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, consider writing about one decision that shaped your system, one assumption that turned out to be wrong, or one constraint that changed your design. Good abstracts often start with a specific moment or choice rather than a broad overview.\nReady to submit? The deadline is\n23rd January\n. Share one decision, one lesson, or one constraint from your production work:\nhttps://jumpingrivers.com/ai-production/\nIf you have questions about whether your work fits the conference, reach out at\n[email protected]\n.
