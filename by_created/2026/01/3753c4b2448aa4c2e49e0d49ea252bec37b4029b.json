(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nAfter passing through rOpenSci peer review, the\ndistionary\npackage is now newly available on CRAN.\nIt allows you to make probability distributions quickly – either from a few inputs or from its built-in library – and then probe them in detail.\nThese distributions form the building blocks that piece together advanced statistical models with the wider\nprobaverse\necosystem, which is built to release modelers from low-level coding so production pipelines stay human-friendly.\nRight now, the other probaverse packages are\ndistplyr\n, allowing you to morph distributions into new forms, and\nfamish\n, allowing you to tune distributions to data.\nDeveloped with risk analysis use cases like climate and insurance in mind, the same tools translate smoothly to simulations, teaching, and other applied settings.\nThis post highlights the top 3 features of this youngest version of distionary.\nLet’s start by loading the package.\nlibrary(distionary)\nFeature 1: more than just Base R distributions\nOf course, all the Base R distributions are available in distionary.\nHere’s everyone’s favourite Normal distribution.\ndst_norm(0, 1)\n\nNormal distribution (continuous)\n--Parameters--\nmean sd\n0 1\n\nplot(dst_norm(0, 1))\nAnd good old Poisson.\ndst_pois(3)\n\nPoisson distribution (discrete)\n--Parameters--\nlambda\n3\n\nplot(dst_pois(3))\nBut there are additional game-changing distributions included, too.\nA\nNull distribution\n, which always evaluates to\nNA\n.\nWhen you’re running an algorithm that encounters an issue, you can return a Null distribution instead of throwing an error.\nEven downstream evaluation steps won’t error out because the code still sees a distribution rather than a bare\nNA\nor\nNULL\n.\n# Make a Null distribution.\nnull <- dst_null()\n# Null distributions always evaluate to NA.\neval_quantile(null, at = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))\n\n[1] NA NA NA\n\nmean(null)\n\n[1] NA\nEmpirical distributions\n, where the data\nare\nthe distribution.\nThese respect observed behaviour without forcing a specific shape, and are also commonly used as a benchmark for comparison against other models.\nHere’s an example using the Ozone concentration from the\nairquality\ndataset that comes loaded with R.\n# Empirical distribution of Ozone from the `airquality` dataset.\nemp <- dst_empirical(airquality$Ozone, na_action_y = \"drop\")\n# Inspect\nprint(emp, n = 5)\n\nFinite distribution (discrete)\n--Parameters--\n# A tibble: 67 × 2\noutcomes probs\n<int> <dbl>\n1 1 0.00862\n2 4 0.00862\n3 6 0.00862\n4 7 0.0259\n5 8 0.00862\n# ℹ 62 more rows\nCompare its\ncumulative distribution function (CDF)\nto that of a Gamma distribution fitted to the Ozone levels, borrowing the probaverse’s famish package for the fitting task.\n# Fit a Gamma distribution to Ozone using the famish package.\nlibrary(famish)\ngamma <- fit_dst_gamma(airquality$Ozone, na_action = \"drop\")\n\n# Plot the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) together.\nplot(emp, \"cdf\", n = 1000, xlab = \"Ozone Levels (ppb)\")\nplot(gamma, \"cdf\", add = TRUE, col = \"red\")\nlegend(\n \"bottomright\",\n legend = c(\"Empirical\", \"Fitted Gamma\"),\n col = c(\"black\", \"red\"),\n lty = 1\n)\nThese textbook distributions become much more useful once they become building blocks for building up a system.\nFor example, they could form predictive distributions in a machine learning context, or be related to other variables.\nThis is what the probaverse seeks to make possible.\nFeature 2: friendly towards tidy tabular workflows\nFirst, load the tidyverse to activate tidy tabular workflows.\nAnd yes, probaverse is named after the tidyverse because it aims to be a “tidyverse for probability”.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nYou can safely ignore this next chunk unless you want to see how I’m wrangling some financial data for you.\n# Wrangle the stocks data frame using tidyverse.\nstocks <- as_tibble(EuStockMarkets) |>\n mutate(across(everything(), \\(x) 100 * (1 - x / lag(x)))) |>\n drop_na()\nThe\nstocks\ndata I’ve wrangled is a table of\ndaily percent loss\nfor four major European stock indices.\nThe dates don’t matter for this example, so they’ve been omitted.\nstocks\n\n# A tibble: 1,859 × 4\nDAX SMI CAC FTSE\n<dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 0.928 -0.620 1.26 -0.679\n2 0.441 0.586 1.86 0.488\n3 -0.904 -0.328 0.576 -0.907\n4 0.178 -0.148 -0.878 -0.579\n5 0.467 0.889 0.511 0.720\n6 -1.25 -0.676 -1.18 -0.855\n7 -0.578 -1.23 -1.32 -0.824\n8 0.287 0.358 0.193 -0.0837\n9 -0.637 -1.11 -0.0171 0.522\n10 -0.118 -0.437 -0.314 -1.41\n# ℹ 1,849 more rows\nFirst, let’s focus on the DAX stock index.\nFit an empirical distribution like last time (notice I’m using a data mask\n1\nin\ndst_empirical()\nthis time).\n# Fit an empirical distribution to the DAX stock index.\ndax <- dst_empirical(DAX, data = stocks)\n# Inspect the CDF.\nplot(dax, xlab = \"Daily Loss (%)\")\nYou can easily calculate some standard quantiles in tabular format so that the inputs are placed alongside the calculated outputs: just use the\nenframe_\nprefix instead of\neval_\nas we did above with the Null distribution.\nenframe_quantile(dax, at = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), arg_name = \"prob\")\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\nprob quantile\n<dbl> <dbl>\n1 0.25 -0.638\n2 0.5 -0.0473\n3 0.75 0.468\nOr, more to the point here – and appealing to probaverse’s soft spot for risk-focused work – you can calculate return levels (also known as “Value at Risk” in financial applications) for specific return periods.\nIf you don’t know what these are, they are just fancy names for quantiles.\nreturn_periods <- c(5, 50, 100, 200, 500)\nenframe_return(\n dax,\n at = return_periods,\n arg_name = \"return_period\",\n fn_prefix = \"daily_loss_pct\"\n)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\nreturn_period daily_loss_pct\n<dbl> <dbl>\n1 5 0.621\n2 50 2.17\n3 100 2.75\n4 200 3.08\n5 500 3.71\nThe tabular output becomes even more powerful when inserted into a table of models, because it facilitates comparisons and trends.\nTo demonstrate, build a model for each stock.

Future goals include:\nBroader coverage.\nExtending beyond univariate continuous distributions so mixed discrete/continuous and multivariate use cases feel first-class.\nRisk-native metrics.\nMaking cost functions, tail expectations, and other decision metrics evaluate more naturally.\nWorkflow ergonomics.\nRelaxing the requirement to supply density/CDF pairs and adding verbs that streamline common\nmutate\n-\nmap\n-\nunnest\npatterns.\nIf this excites you, join the conversation by opening an issue or\ncontributing\n.\nSpecial thanks to the rOpenSci reviewers\nKatrina Brock\nand\nChristophe Dutang\nfor\ninsightful comments\nthat improved this package.\nAlso thanks to\nBGC Engineering Inc.\n, the\nR Consortium\n, and the\nEuropean Space Agency\ntogether with the\nPolitecnico di Milano\nfor supporting this project.\nMeaning I’m referring directly to the column ‘DAX’ without\nstocks$\nas in our above examples.\n↩︎\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nrOpenSci - open tools for open science\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
