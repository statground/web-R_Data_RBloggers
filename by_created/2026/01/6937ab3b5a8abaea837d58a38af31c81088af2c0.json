Walked through the NNLS algorithm step-by-step—turns out ensembling models may beat solo models! Our homegrown version? Surprisingly close to nnls package results ❤️ But, does it really work in real life? 🤷‍♂️\nMotivations\nPreviously we have learnt the workflow of\nTMLE\nand most people would say to use it with Super Learner. But what is Super Learner? The name sounds fancy and cool. Let’s take a look under the hood of how super is this Super Learner. In this blog, we will see what non-negative least square is and what is the algorithm that is behind this method that fuels Super Learner. We’ll take a look at the mathematical procedures and then code from scratch and see if we can reproduce the result. Let’s do this!\nObjectives:\nWhat is Super Learner?\nWhat is the algorithm behind Super Learner?\nNon-negative Least Square\nLawson-Hanson algorithm\nLet’s Put Them All Together\nLet’s Super Learn this thing\nOpportunities for improvement\nLessons learnt\nWhat is Super Learner?\nSuper Learner is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that optimally combines predictions from multiple candidate algorithms to create a single ensembled model. Rather than selecting a single “best” model through traditional model selection methods, Super Learner leverages the strengths of various algorithms by creating a weighted average of their predictions. The fundamental insight is elegant: why choose between a random forest, generalized linear model, or gradient boosting machine when you can let the data determine the optimal combination of all three? This approach was introduced by Mark van der Laan and colleagues and has become particularly popular in causal inference and epidemiology, often paired with Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) to obtain robust, efficient estimates of causal effects.\nWhat is the algorithm behind Super Learner?\nThe beauty of Super Learner lies in its theoretical guarantee: it will perform at least as well as the best single algorithm in your library of candidate learners, and often performs substantially better. This property, known as the\noracle inequality\n, means that Super Learner asymptotically achieves the lowest possible prediction error among the combinations of the candidate algorithms. 🤔 To be transparent, I don’t really understand all these. But, let’s move on. The engine behind this is\nNon-Negative Least Squares (NNLS)\n, an elegant constrained optimization method that finds the optimal weights for combining your candidate algorithms.\nNNLS\nAt its core, NNLS solves a seemingly simple problem: given a matrix\nX\nof predictions from your candidate algorithms and an outcome vector\ny\n, find\nweights β\nthat minimize the squared prediction error\n||y - Xβ||²\nsubject to two crucial constraints:\nall weights must be non-negative (β ≥ 0)\nthe weights must sum to one (ensuring a proper convex combination).\nLawson-Hanson Algorithm\nThe most commonly used algorithm for solving NNLS is the active set method developed by Lawson and Hanson in 1974. This iterative algorithm is remarkably intuitive: it maintains two sets of variables—an “active set” of variables currently in the model with positive weights, and a “passive set” of variables currently excluded (with zero weights). The algorithm begins with all variables in the passive set, then iteratively identifies which passive variable, if added to the active set, would most improve the fit. Once a variable enters the active set, the algorithm solves an unconstrained least squares problem using only the active variables. If any weights become negative during this step, the algorithm removes the most negative variable from the active set and repeats the process. This addition-and-removal dance continues until no passive variables would improve the fit and all active variables have positive weights—at which point we’ve found our optimal solution.\nOK, too many words above. Not a fan. 😵‍💫 Lots of procedures above, let’s break it down to steps and write a simple example with code to go through the process. Let’s create a simple example.\ncode\nX <- rbind(\n  c(1.5,3,4),\n  c(0.5,2,3),\n  c(4.5,6,6)\n)\n\ny <- c(2,1,5)\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{X} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n;\n\\text{y} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nLet’s take a quick look at the matrices above. Just glancing at it you would think the weights for each models (columns) should be within column\n1\nand column\n2\n. Let’s go through Lawson-hanson algorithm procedure\nStep 0: Initialize Your Sets\nStart with all variables in the passive set (R) and none in the active set (P). Like so:\n$$\n\\text{P} = \\emptyset\n$$\n$$\nR = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nP\n: Active Set (Take note, I used P as active, not passive; also these are indexes)\nR\n: Passive Set (take note, these are indexes)\nβ\n: weights\nWe will go throught the iterative procedure below, move Passive set (R) one by one to Active set (P) until we no longer have any passive sets available.\nStep 1 Find Gradient\ncode\n# step 1: find gradient \ngradient <- t(X) %*% (y-X %*% beta)\nif (sum(gradient<=0)==dim(X)[2]) { stop(\"all gradients are zero or negative, we have achieved optimality\") }\nif (length(R)==0) { stop(\"R is empty\")}\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{Gradient} = \\text{X}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot (\\text{y} - \\text{X}\\beta)\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nThe above is the procedure to find gradient for\n||y - Xβ||²\n. Let’s put in the numbers and calculate\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{Gradient} = \\text{X}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot (\\text{y} - \\text{X}\\beta) \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}^\\text{T} \\cdot (\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix} -\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n) \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 0.5 & 4.5 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot (\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix} -\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n) \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 0.5 & 4.5 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n26.5 \\\\ 44 \\\\ 41\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nStep 2 Check Optimality & Find Next Variable to Add To P\nIf all gradients are non-positive, we have achieved optimality. If not, proceed to the next step. Find the index of R of the maximum gradient. In this case, max of\n26.5, 44, 41\nis\n44\n, which is the second column of\nX\n.\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{Next Variable} = \\text{argmax}_{j \\in R} \\text{Gradient}_j \\\\\n= 2\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nWe then move\n2\nfrom\nR\n(passive set) to\nP\n(active set) like so:\n$$\n\\text{P} = \\{2\\}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\{1, 3\\}\n$$\nStep 3 Solve the Unconstrained Least Squares Problem for Active Set P.\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\beta_P = (\\text{X}_P^{\\text{T}} \\cdot \\text{X}_P)^{-1} \\cdot \\text{X}_P^{\\text{T}} \\cdot \\text{y} \\\\\n= (\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix})^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= (9 + 4 + 36)^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= 49^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= 49^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n44\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.8979592\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nWhere\nX_P\nis the sub-matrix of\nX\ncontaining only the columns in the active set\nP\n. In our case,\nP = {2}\n, so\nβ\nis:\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\beta =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0.8979592 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nStill with me? We went from initializing zero weights (beta) for all 3 to now with the second model having weight of\n0.89796\nStep 4 Check For Negative Weights\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{If any } \\beta_P \\leq 0, \\text{ calculate } \\alpha \\text{ else go back to step 1}\\\\\n\\alpha = \\min_{\\beta_P \\leq 0} \\frac{\\beta_{old}}{\\beta_{old} - \\beta_P} \\\\\n\\text{If } \\alpha < 1, \\text{ update } \\beta = \\beta_{old} + \\alpha (\\beta_P - \\beta_{old}) \\\\\n\\text{Remove any variables from P where } \\beta \\leq 0 \\text{ and return them to R}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nSince our weights\n$\\beta$\ncannot be negative, and if we hit a negative value, we want to shift all\n\\(\\beta\\)\nby\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nproportion of the difference and make the calculated negative weight\n0\nand adjust the other weights equally.\nAfter the above, we go iterate until\nR\nset is empty. You get the point, instead of latex the entire calculation, let’s use code to get to our answers.\nP <- c()\nR <- c(1:dim(X)[2])\nbeta <- rep(0, dim(X)[2])\n\nwhile (T) {\n# step 1: find gradient \ngradient <- t(X) %*% (y-X %*% beta)\nif (sum(gradient<=0)==dim(X)[2]) { print(\"all gradients are zero or negative, we have achieved optimality\") ; break }\nif (length(R)==0) { print(\"R is empty\") ; break }\n\n# step 2: check optimality\ngradient_not_active <- gradient\ngradient_not_active[P] <- -Inf\nP_x <- which(gradient_not_active==max(gradient_not_active))\nP <- c(P,P_x) |> unique() |> sort()\nR <- setdiff(R, P_x)\n\n# solve P\nbeta_i <- beta\nbeta_i[P] <- solve(t(X[,P]) %*% X[,P]) %*% t(X[,P])%*%y\nif (any(beta_i<0)) { \n  print(paste0(\"negative weights: \",paste(beta_i, collapse = \" \")))  \n  idx <- which(beta_i<0)\n  beta_old <- beta[idx]\n  beta_new <- beta_i[idx]\n  alpha <- beta_old/-(beta_new-beta_old)\n  beta_i_new <- beta - alpha*(beta-beta_i) \n  beta <- beta_i_new |> round(digits = 4)\n  print(paste0(\"new weights after setting negative weight as zero: \", paste(beta,collapse = \" \")))\n  } else {  beta <- beta_i ; print(beta) }\n}\n\n## [1] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.6721311\n## [1] 0.8683544 0.0000000 0.1810127\n## [1] \"negative weights: 0.666666666666675 0.333333333333364 -7.105427357601e-15\"\n## [1] \"new weights after setting negative weight as zero: 0.6667 0.3333 0\"\n## [1] \"R is empty\"\n\nbeta\n\n## [1] 0.6667 0.3333 0.0000\n\nX %*% beta\n\n##         [,1]\n## [1,] 1.99995\n## [2,] 0.99995\n## [3,] 4.99995\nWow, it worked! Look at our weights (beta) and our final results! As suspected, column 1 and 2 will have the weights (more on column 1) and when combined our final numbers are quite close to our\ny\n, which is 2, 1, 5 . Awesome! Now, let’s simulate more data and see if our code works and compare it with\nnnls\npackage!\nLet’s Put Them All Together\nSimulate Data\n# labels/outcome/y\nnum_labels <- 1000\nlabel_range <- 1:5\ny <- sample(label_range, num_labels, replace=T)\n\n# X matrix\nnum_models <- 5\nX <- matrix(nrow = num_labels, ncol = num_models)\nfor (i in 1:num_models) {\n  sd <- sample(c(0.01,1,10))\n  for (j in 1:num_labels) {\n  X[j, i] <- rnorm(1, mean = y[j], sd = sd)\n}\n}\nAlright, what we did above is basically simulated\ny\nand\nX\nP <- c()\nR <- c(1:dim(X)[2])\nbeta <- rep(0, dim(X)[2])\n\nwhile (T) {\n# step 1: find gradient \ngradient <- t(X) %*% (y-X %*% beta)\nif (sum(gradient<=0)==dim(X)[2]) { print(\"all gradients are zero or negative, we have achieved optimality\") ; break }\nif (length(R)==0) { print(\"R is empty\") ; break }\n\n# step 2: check optimality\ngradient_not_active <- gradient\ngradient_not_active[P] <- -Inf\nP_x <- which(gradient_not_active==max(gradient_not_active))\nP <- c(P,P_x) |> unique() |> sort()\nR <- setdiff(R, P_x)\n\n# solve P\nbeta_i <- beta\nbeta_i[P] <- solve(t(X[,P]) %*% X[,P]) %*% t(X[,P])%*%y\nif (any(beta_i<0)) { \n  print(paste0(\"negative weights: \",paste(beta_i, collapse = \" \")))  \n  idx <- which(beta_i<0)\n  beta_old <- beta[idx]\n  beta_new <- beta_i[idx]\n  alpha <- beta_old/-(beta_new-beta_old)\n  beta_i_new <- beta - alpha*(beta-beta_i) \n  beta <- beta_i_new |> round(digits = 4)\n  print(paste0(\"new weights after setting negative weight as zero: \", paste(beta,collapse = \" \")))\n  } else {  beta <- beta_i ; print(beta) }\n}\n\n## [1] 0.9998029 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n## [1] 0.5145682 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4853314 0.0000000\n## [1] 0.3242697 0.3571370 0.0000000 0.3184922 0.0000000\n## [1] 0.2346782 0.2762402 0.0000000 0.2480602 0.2409658\n## [1] 0.1884031 0.2342831 0.1677427 0.2059978 0.2035208\n## [1] \"R is empty\"\nLet’s look at our weights and RMSE\nbeta\n\n## [1] 0.1884031 0.2342831 0.1677427 0.2059978 0.2035208\n\nsqrt(mean((y - X %*% beta)^2))\n\n## [1] 0.004614622\nLet’s look at\nnnls\npackage and see if we can the same result\nmodel <- nnls::nnls(A=X,b=y)\nmodel\n\n## Nonnegative least squares model\n## x estimates: 0.1884031 0.2342831 0.1677427 0.2059978 0.2035208 \n## residual sum-of-squares: 0.02129\n## reason terminated: The solution has been computed sucessfully.\n\nsqrt(mean((y - X %*% model$x)^2))\n\n## [1] 0.004614622\nwow! Awesome!!! Looks the same or at least very similar. Alright, now we’re at least able to reproduce the nnls portion from scratch. Let’s see if we can simulate a non-linear data and train with different models and see how our end result is!\nLet’s Super Learn this thing\nClick below at\ncode\nto expand for the entire procedures. We basically ran 3 different models in tidymodels, linear regression, xgboost, and random forest with recipe (y ~ .), not specifying any interaction/polynomial relationships for a simulated data below.\nn <- 1000\nx <- rnorm(n)\nw <- rnorm(n, 0.5*x)\ny <- 0.2*x + 0.5*w + 0.2*x*w + 0.05*x^2\nMade sure to set seed for reproducibility, create 5 fold for cross validation. Then extract all the prediction for validation sets from each models and stack them into\nX\nmatrix. Then extract the RMSE from each models and stack them into\nmetrics\nmatrix. Finally, we run our nnls code above to get the weights and RMSE for super learner. We repeat this for 1000 iterations and log the results.\nThis cross-validation step is the defining feature of the Super Learner.

Rather than selecting a single “best” model through traditional model selection methods, Super Learner leverages the strengths of various algorithms by creating a weighted average of their predictions. The fundamental insight is elegant: why choose between a random forest, generalized linear model, or gradient boosting machine when you can let the data determine the optimal combination of all three? This approach was introduced by Mark van der Laan and colleagues and has become particularly popular in causal inference and epidemiology, often paired with Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) to obtain robust, efficient estimates of causal effects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"engine\">What is the algorithm behind Super Learner?\n  <a href=\"https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/superlearner/#engine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h2>\n<p>The beauty of Super Learner lies in its theoretical guarantee: it will perform at least as well as the best single algorithm in your library of candidate learners, and often performs substantially better.

This iterative algorithm is remarkably intuitive: it maintains two sets of variables—an “active set” of variables currently in the model with positive weights, and a “passive set” of variables currently excluded (with zero weights). The algorithm begins with all variables in the passive set, then iteratively identifies which passive variable, if added to the active set, would most improve the fit. Once a variable enters the active set, the algorithm solves an unconstrained least squares problem using only the active variables. If any weights become negative during this step, the algorithm removes the most negative variable from the active set and repeats the process. This addition-and-removal dance continues until no passive variables would improve the fit and all active variables have positive weights—at which point we’ve found our optimal solution.</p>\n<p>OK, too many words above.

It also make sense that if there is a difference in xgboost or random forest model, we would see different weight on the other model contribution.

Walked through the NNLS algorithm step-by-step—turns out ensembling models may beat solo models! Our homegrown version? Surprisingly close to nnls package results ❤️ But, does it really work in real life? 🤷‍♂️\nMotivations\nPreviously we have learnt the workflow of\nTMLE\nand most people would say to use it with Super Learner. But what is Super Learner? The name sounds fancy and cool. Let’s take a look under the hood of how super is this Super Learner. In this blog, we will see what non-negative least square is and what is the algorithm that is behind this method that fuels Super Learner. We’ll take a look at the mathematical procedures and then code from scratch and see if we can reproduce the result. Let’s do this!\nObjectives:\nWhat is Super Learner?\nWhat is the algorithm behind Super Learner?\nNon-negative Least Square\nLawson-Hanson algorithm\nLet’s Put Them All Together\nLet’s Super Learn this thing\nOpportunities for improvement\nLessons learnt\nWhat is Super Learner?\nSuper Learner is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that optimally combines predictions from multiple candidate algorithms to create a single ensembled model. Rather than selecting a single “best” model through traditional model selection methods, Super Learner leverages the strengths of various algorithms by creating a weighted average of their predictions. The fundamental insight is elegant: why choose between a random forest, generalized linear model, or gradient boosting machine when you can let the data determine the optimal combination of all three? This approach was introduced by Mark van der Laan and colleagues and has become particularly popular in causal inference and epidemiology, often paired with Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) to obtain robust, efficient estimates of causal effects.\nWhat is the algorithm behind Super Learner?\nThe beauty of Super Learner lies in its theoretical guarantee: it will perform at least as well as the best single algorithm in your library of candidate learners, and often performs substantially better. This property, known as the\noracle inequality\n, means that Super Learner asymptotically achieves the lowest possible prediction error among the combinations of the candidate algorithms. 🤔 To be transparent, I don’t really understand all these. But, let’s move on. The engine behind this is\nNon-Negative Least Squares (NNLS)\n, an elegant constrained optimization method that finds the optimal weights for combining your candidate algorithms.\nNNLS\nAt its core, NNLS solves a seemingly simple problem: given a matrix\nX\nof predictions from your candidate algorithms and an outcome vector\ny\n, find\nweights β\nthat minimize the squared prediction error\n||y - Xβ||²\nsubject to two crucial constraints:\nall weights must be non-negative (β ≥ 0)\nthe weights must sum to one (ensuring a proper convex combination).\nLawson-Hanson Algorithm\nThe most commonly used algorithm for solving NNLS is the active set method developed by Lawson and Hanson in 1974. This iterative algorithm is remarkably intuitive: it maintains two sets of variables—an “active set” of variables currently in the model with positive weights, and a “passive set” of variables currently excluded (with zero weights). The algorithm begins with all variables in the passive set, then iteratively identifies which passive variable, if added to the active set, would most improve the fit. Once a variable enters the active set, the algorithm solves an unconstrained least squares problem using only the active variables. If any weights become negative during this step, the algorithm removes the most negative variable from the active set and repeats the process. This addition-and-removal dance continues until no passive variables would improve the fit and all active variables have positive weights—at which point we’ve found our optimal solution.\nOK, too many words above. Not a fan. 😵‍💫 Lots of procedures above, let’s break it down to steps and write a simple example with code to go through the process. Let’s create a simple example.\ncode\nX <- rbind(\n  c(1.5,3,4),\n  c(0.5,2,3),\n  c(4.5,6,6)\n)\n\ny <- c(2,1,5)\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{X} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n;\n\\text{y} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nLet’s take a quick look at the matrices above. Just glancing at it you would think the weights for each models (columns) should be within column\n1\nand column\n2\n. Let’s go through Lawson-hanson algorithm procedure\nStep 0: Initialize Your Sets\nStart with all variables in the passive set (R) and none in the active set (P). Like so:\n$$\n\\text{P} = \\emptyset\n$$\n$$\nR = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nP\n: Active Set (Take note, I used P as active, not passive; also these are indexes)\nR\n: Passive Set (take note, these are indexes)\nβ\n: weights\nWe will go throught the iterative procedure below, move Passive set (R) one by one to Active set (P) until we no longer have any passive sets available.\nStep 1 Find Gradient\ncode\n# step 1: find gradient \ngradient <- t(X) %*% (y-X %*% beta)\nif (sum(gradient<=0)==dim(X)[2]) { stop(\"all gradients are zero or negative, we have achieved optimality\") }\nif (length(R)==0) { stop(\"R is empty\")}\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{Gradient} = \\text{X}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot (\\text{y} - \\text{X}\\beta)\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nThe above is the procedure to find gradient for\n||y - Xβ||²\n. Let’s put in the numbers and calculate\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{Gradient} = \\text{X}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot (\\text{y} - \\text{X}\\beta) \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}^\\text{T} \\cdot (\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix} -\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n) \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 0.5 & 4.5 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot (\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix} -\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4.5 & 6 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n) \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1.5 & 0.5 & 4.5 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 3 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n26.5 \\\\ 44 \\\\ 41\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nStep 2 Check Optimality & Find Next Variable to Add To P\nIf all gradients are non-positive, we have achieved optimality. If not, proceed to the next step. Find the index of R of the maximum gradient. In this case, max of\n26.5, 44, 41\nis\n44\n, which is the second column of\nX\n.\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{Next Variable} = \\text{argmax}_{j \\in R} \\text{Gradient}_j \\\\\n= 2\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nWe then move\n2\nfrom\nR\n(passive set) to\nP\n(active set) like so:\n$$\n\\text{P} = \\{2\\}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\{1, 3\\}\n$$\nStep 3 Solve the Unconstrained Least Squares Problem for Active Set P.\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\beta_P = (\\text{X}_P^{\\text{T}} \\cdot \\text{X}_P)^{-1} \\cdot \\text{X}_P^{\\text{T}} \\cdot \\text{y} \\\\\n= (\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix})^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n6\n\\end{bmatrix}^{\\text{T}} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= (9 + 4 + 36)^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 2 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= 49^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 5\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= 49^{-1} \\cdot\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n44\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.8979592\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nWhere\nX_P\nis the sub-matrix of\nX\ncontaining only the columns in the active set\nP\n. In our case,\nP = {2}\n, so\nβ\nis:\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\beta =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\ 0.8979592 \\\\ 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nStill with me? We went from initializing zero weights (beta) for all 3 to now with the second model having weight of\n0.89796\nStep 4 Check For Negative Weights\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\text{If any } \\beta_P \\leq 0, \\text{ calculate } \\alpha \\text{ else go back to step 1}\\\\\n\\alpha = \\min_{\\beta_P \\leq 0} \\frac{\\beta_{old}}{\\beta_{old} - \\beta_P} \\\\\n\\text{If } \\alpha < 1, \\text{ update } \\beta = \\beta_{old} + \\alpha (\\beta_P - \\beta_{old}) \\\\\n\\text{Remove any variables from P where } \\beta \\leq 0 \\text{ and return them to R}\n\\end{gather}\n$$\nSince our weights\n$\\beta$\ncannot be negative, and if we hit a negative value, we want to shift all\n\\(\\beta\\)\nby\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nproportion of the difference and make the calculated negative weight\n0\nand adjust the other weights equally.\nAfter the above, we go iterate until\nR\nset is empty. You get the point, instead of latex the entire calculation, let’s use code to get to our answers.\nP <- c()\nR <- c(1:dim(X)[2])\nbeta <- rep(0, dim(X)[2])\n\nwhile (T) {\n# step 1: find gradient \ngradient <- t(X) %*% (y-X %*% beta)\nif (sum(gradient<=0)==dim(X)[2]) { print(\"all gradients are zero or negative, we have achieved optimality\") ; break }\nif (length(R)==0) { print(\"R is empty\") ; break }\n\n# step 2: check optimality\ngradient_not_active <- gradient\ngradient_not_active[P] <- -Inf\nP_x <- which(gradient_not_active==max(gradient_not_active))\nP <- c(P,P_x) |> unique() |> sort()\nR <- setdiff(R, P_x)\n\n# solve P\nbeta_i <- beta\nbeta_i[P] <- solve(t(X[,P]) %*% X[,P]) %*% t(X[,P])%*%y\nif (any(beta_i<0)) { \n  print(paste0(\"negative weights: \",paste(beta_i, collapse = \" \")))  \n  idx <- which(beta_i<0)\n  beta_old <- beta[idx]\n  beta_new <- beta_i[idx]\n  alpha <- beta_old/-(beta_new-beta_old)\n  beta_i_new <- beta - alpha*(beta-beta_i) \n  beta <- beta_i_new |> round(digits = 4)\n  print(paste0(\"new weights after setting negative weight as zero: \", paste(beta,collapse = \" \")))\n  } else {  beta <- beta_i ; print(beta) }\n}\n\n## [1] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.6721311\n## [1] 0.8683544 0.0000000 0.1810127\n## [1] \"negative weights: 0.666666666666675 0.333333333333364 -7.105427357601e-15\"\n## [1] \"new weights after setting negative weight as zero: 0.6667 0.3333 0\"\n## [1] \"R is empty\"\n\nbeta\n\n## [1] 0.6667 0.3333 0.0000\n\nX %*% beta\n\n##         [,1]\n## [1,] 1.99995\n## [2,] 0.99995\n## [3,] 4.99995\nWow, it worked! Look at our weights (beta) and our final results! As suspected, column 1 and 2 will have the weights (more on column 1) and when combined our final numbers are quite close to our\ny\n, which is 2, 1, 5 . Awesome! Now, let’s simulate more data and see if our code works and compare it with\nnnls\npackage!\nLet’s Put Them All Together\nSimulate Data\n# labels/outcome/y\nnum_labels <- 1000\nlabel_range <- 1:5\ny <- sample(label_range, num_labels, replace=T)\n\n# X matrix\nnum_models <- 5\nX <- matrix(nrow = num_labels, ncol = num_models)\nfor (i in 1:num_models) {\n  sd <- sample(c(0.01,1,10))\n  for (j in 1:num_labels) {\n  X[j, i] <- rnorm(1, mean = y[j], sd = sd)\n}\n}\nAlright, what we did above is basically simulated\ny\nand\nX\nP <- c()\nR <- c(1:dim(X)[2])\nbeta <- rep(0, dim(X)[2])\n\nwhile (T) {\n# step 1: find gradient \ngradient <- t(X) %*% (y-X %*% beta)\nif (sum(gradient<=0)==dim(X)[2]) { print(\"all gradients are zero or negative, we have achieved optimality\") ; break }\nif (length(R)==0) { print(\"R is empty\") ; break }\n\n# step 2: check optimality\ngradient_not_active <- gradient\ngradient_not_active[P] <- -Inf\nP_x <- which(gradient_not_active==max(gradient_not_active))\nP <- c(P,P_x) |> unique() |> sort()\nR <- setdiff(R, P_x)\n\n# solve P\nbeta_i <- beta\nbeta_i[P] <- solve(t(X[,P]) %*% X[,P]) %*% t(X[,P])%*%y\nif (any(beta_i<0)) { \n  print(paste0(\"negative weights: \",paste(beta_i, collapse = \" \")))  \n  idx <- which(beta_i<0)\n  beta_old <- beta[idx]\n  beta_new <- beta_i[idx]\n  alpha <- beta_old/-(beta_new-beta_old)\n  beta_i_new <- beta - alpha*(beta-beta_i) \n  beta <- beta_i_new |> round(digits = 4)\n  print(paste0(\"new weights after setting negative weight as zero: \", paste(beta,collapse = \" \")))\n  } else {  beta <- beta_i ; print(beta) }\n}\n\n## [1] 0.9998029 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n## [1] 0.5145682 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4853314 0.0000000\n## [1] 0.3242697 0.3571370 0.0000000 0.3184922 0.0000000\n## [1] 0.2346782 0.2762402 0.0000000 0.2480602 0.2409658\n## [1] 0.1884031 0.2342831 0.1677427 0.2059978 0.2035208\n## [1] \"R is empty\"\nLet’s look at our weights and RMSE\nbeta\n\n## [1] 0.1884031 0.2342831 0.1677427 0.2059978 0.2035208\n\nsqrt(mean((y - X %*% beta)^2))\n\n## [1] 0.004614622\nLet’s look at\nnnls\npackage and see if we can the same result\nmodel <- nnls::nnls(A=X,b=y)\nmodel\n\n## Nonnegative least squares model\n## x estimates: 0.1884031 0.2342831 0.1677427 0.2059978 0.2035208 \n## residual sum-of-squares: 0.02129\n## reason terminated: The solution has been computed sucessfully.\n\nsqrt(mean((y - X %*% model$x)^2))\n\n## [1] 0.004614622\nwow! Awesome!!! Looks the same or at least very similar. Alright, now we’re at least able to reproduce the nnls portion from scratch. Let’s see if we can simulate a non-linear data and train with different models and see how our end result is!\nLet’s Super Learn this thing\nClick below at\ncode\nto expand for the entire procedures. We basically ran 3 different models in tidymodels, linear regression, xgboost, and random forest with recipe (y ~ .), not specifying any interaction/polynomial relationships for a simulated data below.\nn <- 1000\nx <- rnorm(n)\nw <- rnorm(n, 0.5*x)\ny <- 0.2*x + 0.5*w + 0.2*x*w + 0.05*x^2\nMade sure to set seed for reproducibility, create 5 fold for cross validation. Then extract all the prediction for validation sets from each models and stack them into\nX\nmatrix. Then extract the RMSE from each models and stack them into\nmetrics\nmatrix. Finally, we run our nnls code above to get the weights and RMSE for super learner. We repeat this for 1000 iterations and log the results.\nThis cross-validation step is the defining feature of the Super Learner. By fitting each base learner on training folds and generating out-of-fold predictions, we obtain an unbiased prediction matrix that is then used to estimate optimal ensemble weights via NNLS.\ncode\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(future)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\n# Set up parallel processing\nplan(multisession, workers = availableCores() - 2)\n\n# Define the function to run for each iteration\nrun_iteration <- function(i) {\n  set.seed(i)\n  n <- 1000\n  x <- rnorm(n)\n  w <- rnorm(n, 0.5*x)\n  y <- 0.2*x + 0.5*w + 0.2*x*w + 0.05*x^2\n  \n  df <- tibble(x,w,y)\n  split <- initial_split(df)\n  train <- training(split)\n  test <- testing(split)\n  # preprocess\n  rec <- recipe(y ~ ., data=train) \n  \n  # linear regression\n  lr_spec <- linear_reg()\n  wf <- workflow() |>\n    add_recipe(rec) |>\n    add_model(lr_spec)\n  folds <- vfold_cv(train, 5)\n  cv_results <- wf |>\n    fit_resamples(folds, control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE))\n  cv_metrics <- collect_metrics(cv_results) |> filter(.metric == \"rmse\") |> pull(mean)\n  cv_preds <- collect_predictions(cv_results) \n  \n  #xgboost\n  xgb_spec <- boost_tree(engine = \"xgboost\", mode = \"regression\")\n  wf <- workflow() |>\n    add_recipe(rec) |>\n    add_model(xgb_spec)\n  cv_results <- wf |>\n    fit_resamples(folds, control = control_resamples(save_pred = T))\n  cv_metrics2 <- collect_metrics(cv_results) |> filter(.metric == \"rmse\") |> pull(mean)\n  cv_preds2 <- collect_predictions(cv_results) \n  \n  # random forest\n  rf_spec <- rand_forest(mode = \"regression\")\n  wf <- workflow() |>\n    add_recipe(rec) |>\n    add_model(rf_spec)\n  cv_results <- wf |>\n    fit_resamples(folds, control = control_resamples(save_pred = T))\n  cv_metrics3 <- collect_metrics(cv_results) |> filter(.metric == \"rmse\") |> pull(mean)\n  cv_preds3 <- collect_predictions(cv_results) |>\n    mutate(model = \"rf\")\n  X <- cbind(cv_preds |> select(X1=.pred),cv_preds2 |> select(X2=.pred), cv_preds3 |> select(X3=.pred)) |> as.matrix()\n  y <- cv_preds |> select(y) |> as.matrix()\n  metrics <- cbind(cv_metrics,cv_metrics2,cv_metrics3)\n  \n  # nnls\n  P <- c()\n  R <- c(1:dim(X)[2])\n  beta <- rep(0, dim(X)[2])\n  \n  while (T) {\n    # step 1: find gradient \n    gradient <- t(X) %*% (y-X %*% beta)\n    if (sum(gradient<=0)==dim(X)[2]) { print(\"all gradients are zero or negative, we have achieved optimality\") ; break }\n    if (length(R)==0) { print(\"R is empty\") ; break }\n    # step 2: check optimality\n    gradient_not_active <- gradient\n    gradient_not_active[P] <- -Inf\n    P_x <- which(gradient_not_active==max(gradient_not_active))\n    P <- c(P,P_x) |> unique() |> sort()\n    R <- setdiff(R, P_x)\n    # solve P\n    beta_i <- beta\n    beta_i[P] <- solve(t(X[,P]) %*% X[,P]) %*% t(X[,P])%*%y\n    if (any(beta_i<0)) { \n      print(paste0(\"negative weights: \",paste(beta_i, collapse = \" \")))  \n      idx <- which(beta_i<0)\n      beta_old <- beta[idx]\n      beta_new <- beta_i[idx]\n      alpha <- beta_old/-(beta_new-beta_old)\n      beta_i_new <- beta - alpha*(beta-beta_i) \n      beta <- beta_i_new |> round(digits = 4)\n      print(paste0(\"new weights after setting negative weight as zero: \", paste(beta,collapse = \" \")))\n    } else {  beta <- beta_i ; print(beta) }\n  }\n\n  rmse_superlearner <- sqrt(mean((y - X %*% beta)^2))\n  rmse_result <- if (sum(metrics < rmse_superlearner) >= 1) { \"solo_better\" } else { \"superlearner_better\" }\n  \n  model <- nnls::nnls(A=X,b=y)\n  rmse_ours_nnls <- c(rmse_superlearner, sqrt(mean((y - X %*% model$x)^2)))\n  same_weights_result <- if (sum(round(beta, 4) == round(model$x, 4)) == 3) { \"same\" } else { \"not_same\" }\n  weights_log <- c(model$x, beta)\n  \n  return(list(rmse_log = rmse_result, same_weights_log = same_weights_result, weights_log=weights_log))\n}\n\n# Run with future_map\nresults <- future_map(1:1000, run_iteration, .options = furrr_options(seed = TRUE), .progress = TRUE)\nLet’s Compare RMSE of Solo models vs Super Learner models\ncode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Extract results\nrmse_log <- map_chr(results, \"rmse_log\")\nsame_weights_log <- map_chr(results, \"same_weights_log\")\nweight_logs <- matrix(NA, ncol = 6, nrow = 1000)\nfor (i in 1:1000) {\n  weight_logs[i, 1:6] <- results[[i]]$weights_log\n}\n\nplotrmse_log <- tibble(rmse=rmse_log) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=rmse)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_bw()\nWow, look at that! superlearner/ensembled model does appear to have better RMSE compared to solo models!

Rather than selecting a single “best” model through traditional model selection methods, Super Learner leverages the strengths of various algorithms by creating a weighted average of their predictions. The fundamental insight is elegant: why choose between a random forest, generalized linear model, or gradient boosting machine when you can let the data determine the optimal combination of all three? This approach was introduced by Mark van der Laan and colleagues and has become particularly popular in causal inference and epidemiology, often paired with Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) to obtain robust, efficient estimates of causal effects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"engine\">What is the algorithm behind Super Learner?\n  <a href=\"https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/superlearner/#engine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-symbol\" height=\"26\" viewbox=\"0 0 22 22\" width=\"26\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n<path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"currentColor\"></path>\n<path d=\"M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z\"></path>\n</svg></a>\n</h2>\n<p>The beauty of Super Learner lies in its theoretical guarantee: it will perform at least as well as the best single algorithm in your library of candidate learners, and often performs substantially better.

This iterative algorithm is remarkably intuitive: it maintains two sets of variables—an “active set” of variables currently in the model with positive weights, and a “passive set” of variables currently excluded (with zero weights). The algorithm begins with all variables in the passive set, then iteratively identifies which passive variable, if added to the active set, would most improve the fit. Once a variable enters the active set, the algorithm solves an unconstrained least squares problem using only the active variables. If any weights become negative during this step, the algorithm removes the most negative variable from the active set and repeats the process. This addition-and-removal dance continues until no passive variables would improve the fit and all active variables have positive weights—at which point we’ve found our optimal solution.</p>\n<p>OK, too many words above.

It also make sense that if there is a difference in xgboost or random forest model, we would see different weight on the other model contribution.
