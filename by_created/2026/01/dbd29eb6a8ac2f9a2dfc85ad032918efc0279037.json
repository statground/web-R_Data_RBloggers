  "html_title": "Releasing dfms 1.0: Fast and Feature-Rich Estimation of Dynamic Factor Models in R | R-bloggers",
  "meta_description": "I am very happy to announce the release of dfms version 1.0 (and 0.4.0 just a week earlier, see news), implementing major features such as support for dynamic factor models (DFMs) with autoregressive errors, mixed-frequency (monthly-quarterly) DFMs, including with autoregressive errors, and decomposition of forecast revisions into news releases (updates to time series) following Banbura and Modugno (2014)—supporting interpretable nowcasts for one or multiple monthly or quarterly targets. This completes the planned scope of the package: the full, computationally efficient, and easily accessible implementation of the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) in R. Together with this major release, dfms has now been successfully peer-reviewed by two academic reviewers through the rOpenSci Software Peer Review, and was published by rOpenSci—the repo now lives at github.com/ropensci/dfms and the website at docs.ropensci.org/dfms (redirects are in place). dfms 1.0 thus provides a feature-rich, easy-to-use, computationally efficient (C++ powered), and verified toolset to estimate and work with DFMs in R. It also seamlessly integrates with the R language and its common methods and design patterns for statistical packages. It is well documented via a theoretical and practical vignette and detailed function documentation, and thus offers an excellent entry point for young researchers and practitioners interested in DFMs and nowcasting. I therefore hope that its uptake within the scientific and R communities will increase. The release also marks a major milestone for a package that was first put on CRAN in October 2022 to estimate a simple, single frequency DFM—especially given that I don’t sit in a Central Bank or do macro/business cycle analysis for a living. I also never had a natural fascination for Kalman Filters. Rather, a series of professional coincidences over the course of 5 years eventually culminated in this package. I thus want to briefly reflect on the history of dfms before I demonstrate its new features. The Story of dfms: From Simple Beginnings to Fully-Featured DFM Package As an economist training in macroeconomics, trade, and development, I got to know about DFMs almost by accident during my Master’s in Geneva at a summer school on “Big Data in Macroeconomics and Finance” at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in 2018—which also marks my first encounter with the Kiel Institute where I ended up doing my PhD. The course covered a variety of topics via external lecturers: household finance, social networks, geospatial big data, text mining, and also a day of “Nowcasting” with Michele Modugno from the Federal Reserve Board—where he presented his mixed-frequency DFM methodology that dfms now efficiently implements in R and C++. I didn’t understand much of it back then and was more interested in the other topics, but I had gotten the gist of it. Following my Master’s, I was posted to Uganda as an ODI Fellow on a 2-year assignment (2020/21) in the Macroeconomic Policy Department of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MoFPED). Most of my work involved financial programming, data science, and other kinds of econometric and CGE analysis. In spring 2021, I was, however, working part-time on a research paper on Macroeconomic Dynamics and the Effects of Fiscal Spending in Uganda. Its aim was to assess the dynamic impact of fiscal spending on the Ugandan economy and answer a few critical questions that kept coming up, such as are we crowding out credit to the private sector? What happens to interest/tbill rates when we spend more? and what is the economic/growth impact of our spending? Annual time series in Uganda are relatively short, but we observed fiscal spending and a few other key indicators on a monthly basis. Putting together a monthly estimation dataset was thus key for meaningful dynamic modelling. The main monthly indicator of economic activity in Uganda with some history is the Composite Index of Economic Activity (CIEA) published by the Bank of Uganda. It combines 10 monthly series: real currency in circulation, real VAT on domestic goods, real exports of goods and services, real imports, real government expenditure, real sales of selected companies, real cement production, real excise taxes, real PAYE and real private sector credit. They are combined by first using the Henderson Moving Average procedure for seasonal adjustment and separation of irregular components, and aggregation of the trend-cycle series into a composite trend-cycle indicator using weights derived from PCA and correlations of series with quarterly GDP. And that is where my problem was—the inclusion of real government expenditure in this index defeated my purposes of using it to assess fiscal spending impacts. I thus needed an index without it, and I also thought the removal of irregular components and complicated aggregation procedure was suboptimal for research purposes. I wanted a simple, transparent procedure to obtain a monthly indicator of economic activity for Uganda, and a basic DFM with a single factor seemed the appropriate \\[\\textbf{x}_t = \\textbf{c} f_t + \\textbf{e}_t \\ \\sim\\ N(\\textbf{0}, \\textbf{R})\\] \\[f_t = \\sum_{j=1}^p a_j f_{t-j} + u_t \\ \\sim\\ N(0, q)\\] methodology—with observation weights c and transition coefficients \\(a_j\\) to be jointly estimated. So I looked for a simple implementation of DFMs and found, on GitHub, the R package dynfactoR by Rtys Bagduzinas that estimated single-frequency DFMs with the EM/QML algorithm following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2012), and also produced PCA and 2-step estimates following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2011). It used a Julia backend for some of the filters, thus I forked it and made some changes—rewriting the Kalman Filter and Smoother and some parts of the EM algorithm in Armadillo C++, and linking through Rcpp. The package served the purposes of my paper well, and I had thought of creating something more organized and releasing it to CRAN, but didn’t follow through at that point (2021) as I was wrapping up my assignment in Uganda. I returned to dynfactoR a year later in the early stages of my PhD—still working on empirical macroeconomics in Africa—and managed to refactor the package and put a first version on CRAN. For this refactor, I took much inspiration from the excellent vars package to estimate (S)VAR and (S)VEC models in R, which provides a compelling nomenclature with main function VAR() and tight observance of the object-oriented conventions for statistical R packages—including print(), plot(), coef(), summary(), residuals(), fitted(), predict(), and logLik() methods for the varest objects returned by VAR(), and various other methods, e.g., print() and plot() for the varprd objects returned by predict(). It also provides information criteria to select the VAR lag order via VARselect(). Furthermore, its function documentation includes mathematical formulations alongside brief explanations, which I liked a lot. I thus got inspired and called the package dfms, with main function DFM(), implemented information criteria to select the number of factors r following Bai and Ng (2002) in ICr(), including a screeplot() method following Onatski (2010),1 and a comprehensive set of methods like vars. I also exported the C++ Kalman Filter and Smoother—which to my knowledge is still the most efficient implementation in R—alongside the function tsnarmimp() to impute time series matrices using cubic splines and moving averages (needed internally to obtain initial PCA-based system matrices to initialize the Kalman Filter), and Armadillo’s inverse and pseudo-inverse functions which I found somewhat more robust than R’s native ones. dfms version 0.1.3, including these features, hit CRAN in October 2022, and I introduced it with a brief blog post. I also submitted it for the rOpenSci Software Peer Review as I thought that might increase its quality. It then occurred, one year into the PhD, that I was getting a bit bored in Kiel during the winter of 2022/23, and, through connections, organized myself a 3-month research visit at Stellenbosch University in South Africa—from February-April 2023. Parts of the department were very interested in nowcasting the South African economy. They had attempted it with regression and ML-based approaches, but, given my dfms package on CRAN, they asked me to work on an interpretable DFM-based methodology. This interest in nowcasting was warranted as, in the spring of 2023, the South African energy crisis was at its peak, with the implementation of load-shedding level 6—which meant about 8 hours per day on generators—inducing justified fears that it would stifle the South African economy. Thus, I set out to implement a mixed-frequency DFM to nowcast the South African economy, particularly real GDP and unemployment. The first step, which took up much of my time, was to assemble and automate a database of high quality macroeconomic indicators. I ended up creating the South Africa Macroeconomic Database (SAMADB)—an open relational database with ~10,000 macroeconomic time series obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and Statistics South Africa (STATSSA) and updated on a weekly basis via EconData and automated scraping of the SARB and STATSSA websites. I hosted it on servers at Codera Analytics, implemented the updating through GitHub Actions, and created the samadb R package for easy access. As of January 2026, the weekly updates still run, and the R package enjoys almost 15,000 downloads per month. I also wrote Python and Julia packages as these languages were more popular in the department. With the database in place, I took a deep-dive on DFMs for nowcasting applications, revisiting the workshop materials by Michele Modugno, carefully reading Banbura and Modugno (2014), and looking at various nowcasting codes. The theoretical vignette, published in March 2023, is a result of this deep-dive and was principally written to assist my own understanding. I started implementing some of the features described there, and also received the rOpenSci software reviews during this time, which helped me improve the package. I released dfms 0.2.0, adding autoregressive errors and various smaller improvements, to CRAN at the end of March 2023. I mention in the news for that release that “I plan to implement all features described in this vignette until summer 2023”, but that turned out to be highly optimistic. With one month to go in my research visit, it dawned on me that I wouldn’t be able to complete dfms and build a nowcasting model in good time. Thus, I switched to Python, where Chad Fulton had done some excellent work implementing the DynamicFactorMQ class for mixed-frequency nowcasting in statsmodels alongside a comprehensive tutorial. Following selection of a set of indicators for nowcasting, integration with the database and running the model on a weekly basis—also implemented through GitHub Actions—went quite smoothly. I presented the database, model, and model evaluation results at the Bureau of Economic Research seminar in Stellenbosch on April 20. It was a great success, with additional staff from the Reserve Bank, Treasury, and Statistics South Africa joining online. Afterwards, and as announced in the slides, I devoted the rest of my time and also some time in April/May to the development of a NY-Fed-style Nowcasting Dashboard hosted through Codera Analytics at nowcast.codera.co.za and published in May 2023. Built with Dash and Plotly in Python, it provides interactive visualizations of the nowcast evolution and the data releases driving it, as well as historical nowcasting performance and release impacts by sector. This South Africa Nowcasting Model ran until November 2024, when it broke down due to the unavailability of some time series. So that is also a warning right there—if you are building a nowcasting platform using dfms or other tools, make sure you have a robust data pipeline in place and only include series that will remain available for years. With the nowcasting platform in place, and the initial software reviews completed, there was not much urgency to work more on dfms. I had shifted my research interests to infrastructure and value chains in Africa, and was busy with other projects. rOpenSci editors kept pinging me in 2024 for the resubmit, but I was wrapping up my PhD, and also still had the ambition to implement mixed-frequency features. This state dragged on for a while after the PhD defense (Nov’24) as I was consulting, job-searching, and doing other things, but I managed, in May 2025, to push out dfms 0.3.0 with the mixed-frequency DFM implementation and resubmitted it to rOpenSci. The reviewers approved, and, given that it was to be published through rOpenSci in January 2026, I forced myself to complete the scope of the package. I thus spent two intense weekends and pushed out dfms 0.4.0, adding support for mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors, on January 18, followed by this monumental 1.0.0 release, including the news decomposition following Banbura and Modugno (2014), full-state predictions, a package logo and updated practical vignette, on January 26. The package was then published through rOpenSci, which means the repo moved to rOpenSci GitHub and its docs are served from docs.ropensci.org. The final push was greatly facilitated by the availability of modern AI, in particular Cursor and the Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 Codex models, which could take into context Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s original Matlab code and their paper + appendix, and help make and execute detailed implementation plans. I tested these by translating the Matlab code to Julia and testing it against R—using the Cursor debugger to hunt down complicated bugs. This thus concludes the story of dfms—from simple single-frequency package to a full-blown DFM/nowcasting library in four years. Apart from some differences in design choices, Kalman Filter initialization, and reporting, the package produces identical results to Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s research codes. The literature on DFMs has, of course, moved on—with regime switching/time-varying volatility/parameter Bayesian DFMs now the state of the art.2 Since the state of the art is complicated and computationally intense though, and the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) works very well when shocks are moderate—we also tested the DFM against various ML/DL based approaches on US data, including the COVID shock, and found that it outperformed most ML/DL methods—I believe dfms 1.0+ can serve the community well, and I hope that it will find use in academia and policy institutions. New dfms Features: Mixed Frequency DFMs with Autoregressive Errors, Full-State Predictions, and Multi-Target News Decomposition The two latest dfms updates principally introduce three new features: (1) mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors implemented in dfms 0.4.0; (2) decomposition of forecast revisions into news contributions following Banbura and Modugno (2014), and (3) full-state predictions and forecasts implemented in dfms 1.0.0. To stick with the context of its history, and since the documentation and vignette provide lots of examples using the included dataset of Banbura and Modugno (2014), I will re-estimate my South Africa nowcasting model with the last available vintages for end-November and early-December 2024. library(fastverse) ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 -- ## v data.table 1.17.0 v kit 0.0.21 ## v magrittr 2.0.4 v collapse 2.1.6 fastverse_extend(xts, dfms, readxl) ## -- Attaching extension packages --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 -- ## v xts 0.14.1 v readxl 1.4.5 ## v dfms 1.0.0 ## -- Conflicts ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse_conflicts() -- ## x xts::first() masks data.table::first() ## x xts::last() masks data.table::last() ## x dfms::news() masks utils::news() # Get Last November 2024 Vintage download.file(\"https://github.com/coderaanalytics-models/SA-Nowcast/raw/refs/heads/main/vintages/econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", destfile = \"econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", mode = \"wb\") data_m qDT() |> as.xts() ncol(data_m) ## [1] 54 data_q qDT() |> fmutate(date = as.Date(date)) |> # dfms expects quarterly data to be released on the 3rd month of each quarter within(lubridate::month(date) as.xts() colnames(data_q) ## [1] \"UNEMP\" \"GDP\" \"RGDP\" # The xts data format makes temporal merging and subsetting very easy data",

To stick with the context of its history, and since the documentation and vignette provide lots of examples using the included dataset of Banbura and Modugno (2014), I will re-estimate my South Africa nowcasting model with the last available vintages for end-November and early-December 2024. library(fastverse) ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 -- ## v data.table 1.17.0 v kit 0.0.21 ## v magrittr 2.0.4 v collapse 2.1.6 fastverse_extend(xts, dfms, readxl) ## -- Attaching extension packages --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 -- ## v xts 0.14.1 v readxl 1.4.5 ## v dfms 1.0.0 ## -- Conflicts ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse_conflicts() -- ## x xts::first() masks data.table::first() ## x xts::last() masks data.table::last() ## x dfms::news() masks utils::news() # Get Last November 2024 Vintage download.file(\"https://github.com/coderaanalytics-models/SA-Nowcast/raw/refs/heads/main/vintages/econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", destfile = \"econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", mode = \"wb\") data_m qDT() |> as.xts() ncol(data_m) ## [1] 54 data_q qDT() |> fmutate(date = as.Date(date)) |> # dfms expects quarterly data to be released on the 3rd month of each quarter within(lubridate::month(date) as.xts() colnames(data_q) ## [1] \"UNEMP\" \"GDP\" \"RGDP\" # The xts data format makes temporal merging and subsetting very easy data",

    "og_description": "I am very happy to announce the release of dfms version 1.0 (and 0.4.0 just a week earlier, see news), implementing major features such as support for dynamic factor models (DFMs) with autoregressive errors, mixed-frequency (monthly-quarterly) DFMs, including with autoregressive errors, and decomposition of forecast revisions into news releases (updates to time series) following Banbura and Modugno (2014)—supporting interpretable nowcasts for one or multiple monthly or quarterly targets. This completes the planned scope of the package: the full, computationally efficient, and easily accessible implementation of the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) in R. Together with this major release, dfms has now been successfully peer-reviewed by two academic reviewers through the rOpenSci Software Peer Review, and was published by rOpenSci—the repo now lives at github.com/ropensci/dfms and the website at docs.ropensci.org/dfms (redirects are in place). dfms 1.0 thus provides a feature-rich, easy-to-use, computationally efficient (C++ powered), and verified toolset to estimate and work with DFMs in R. It also seamlessly integrates with the R language and its common methods and design patterns for statistical packages. It is well documented via a theoretical and practical vignette and detailed function documentation, and thus offers an excellent entry point for young researchers and practitioners interested in DFMs and nowcasting. I therefore hope that its uptake within the scientific and R communities will increase. The release also marks a major milestone for a package that was first put on CRAN in October 2022 to estimate a simple, single frequency DFM—especially given that I don’t sit in a Central Bank or do macro/business cycle analysis for a living. I also never had a natural fascination for Kalman Filters. Rather, a series of professional coincidences over the course of 5 years eventually culminated in this package. I thus want to briefly reflect on the history of dfms before I demonstrate its new features. The Story of dfms: From Simple Beginnings to Fully-Featured DFM Package As an economist training in macroeconomics, trade, and development, I got to know about DFMs almost by accident during my Master’s in Geneva at a summer school on “Big Data in Macroeconomics and Finance” at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in 2018—which also marks my first encounter with the Kiel Institute where I ended up doing my PhD. The course covered a variety of topics via external lecturers: household finance, social networks, geospatial big data, text mining, and also a day of “Nowcasting” with Michele Modugno from the Federal Reserve Board—where he presented his mixed-frequency DFM methodology that dfms now efficiently implements in R and C++. I didn’t understand much of it back then and was more interested in the other topics, but I had gotten the gist of it. Following my Master’s, I was posted to Uganda as an ODI Fellow on a 2-year assignment (2020/21) in the Macroeconomic Policy Department of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MoFPED). Most of my work involved financial programming, data science, and other kinds of econometric and CGE analysis. In spring 2021, I was, however, working part-time on a research paper on Macroeconomic Dynamics and the Effects of Fiscal Spending in Uganda. Its aim was to assess the dynamic impact of fiscal spending on the Ugandan economy and answer a few critical questions that kept coming up, such as are we crowding out credit to the private sector? What happens to interest/tbill rates when we spend more? and what is the economic/growth impact of our spending? Annual time series in Uganda are relatively short, but we observed fiscal spending and a few other key indicators on a monthly basis. Putting together a monthly estimation dataset was thus key for meaningful dynamic modelling. The main monthly indicator of economic activity in Uganda with some history is the Composite Index of Economic Activity (CIEA) published by the Bank of Uganda. It combines 10 monthly series: real currency in circulation, real VAT on domestic goods, real exports of goods and services, real imports, real government expenditure, real sales of selected companies, real cement production, real excise taxes, real PAYE and real private sector credit. They are combined by first using the Henderson Moving Average procedure for seasonal adjustment and separation of irregular components, and aggregation of the trend-cycle series into a composite trend-cycle indicator using weights derived from PCA and correlations of series with quarterly GDP. And that is where my problem was—the inclusion of real government expenditure in this index defeated my purposes of using it to assess fiscal spending impacts. I thus needed an index without it, and I also thought the removal of irregular components and complicated aggregation procedure was suboptimal for research purposes. I wanted a simple, transparent procedure to obtain a monthly indicator of economic activity for Uganda, and a basic DFM with a single factor seemed the appropriate \\[\\textbf{x}_t = \\textbf{c} f_t + \\textbf{e}_t \\ \\sim\\ N(\\textbf{0}, \\textbf{R})\\] \\[f_t = \\sum_{j=1}^p a_j f_{t-j} + u_t \\ \\sim\\ N(0, q)\\] methodology—with observation weights c and transition coefficients \\(a_j\\) to be jointly estimated. So I looked for a simple implementation of DFMs and found, on GitHub, the R package dynfactoR by Rtys Bagduzinas that estimated single-frequency DFMs with the EM/QML algorithm following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2012), and also produced PCA and 2-step estimates following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2011). It used a Julia backend for some of the filters, thus I forked it and made some changes—rewriting the Kalman Filter and Smoother and some parts of the EM algorithm in Armadillo C++, and linking through Rcpp. The package served the purposes of my paper well, and I had thought of creating something more organized and releasing it to CRAN, but didn’t follow through at that point (2021) as I was wrapping up my assignment in Uganda. I returned to dynfactoR a year later in the early stages of my PhD—still working on empirical macroeconomics in Africa—and managed to refactor the package and put a first version on CRAN. For this refactor, I took much inspiration from the excellent vars package to estimate (S)VAR and (S)VEC models in R, which provides a compelling nomenclature with main function VAR() and tight observance of the object-oriented conventions for statistical R packages—including print(), plot(), coef(), summary(), residuals(), fitted(), predict(), and logLik() methods for the varest objects returned by VAR(), and various other methods, e.g., print() and plot() for the varprd objects returned by predict(). It also provides information criteria to select the VAR lag order via VARselect(). Furthermore, its function documentation includes mathematical formulations alongside brief explanations, which I liked a lot. I thus got inspired and called the package dfms, with main function DFM(), implemented information criteria to select the number of factors r following Bai and Ng (2002) in ICr(), including a screeplot() method following Onatski (2010),1 and a comprehensive set of methods like vars. I also exported the C++ Kalman Filter and Smoother—which to my knowledge is still the most efficient implementation in R—alongside the function tsnarmimp() to impute time series matrices using cubic splines and moving averages (needed internally to obtain initial PCA-based system matrices to initialize the Kalman Filter), and Armadillo’s inverse and pseudo-inverse functions which I found somewhat more robust than R’s native ones. dfms version 0.1.3, including these features, hit CRAN in October 2022, and I introduced it with a brief blog post. I also submitted it for the rOpenSci Software Peer Review as I thought that might increase its quality. It then occurred, one year into the PhD, that I was getting a bit bored in Kiel during the winter of 2022/23, and, through connections, organized myself a 3-month research visit at Stellenbosch University in South Africa—from February-April 2023. Parts of the department were very interested in nowcasting the South African economy. They had attempted it with regression and ML-based approaches, but, given my dfms package on CRAN, they asked me to work on an interpretable DFM-based methodology. This interest in nowcasting was warranted as, in the spring of 2023, the South African energy crisis was at its peak, with the implementation of load-shedding level 6—which meant about 8 hours per day on generators—inducing justified fears that it would stifle the South African economy. Thus, I set out to implement a mixed-frequency DFM to nowcast the South African economy, particularly real GDP and unemployment. The first step, which took up much of my time, was to assemble and automate a database of high quality macroeconomic indicators. I ended up creating the South Africa Macroeconomic Database (SAMADB)—an open relational database with ~10,000 macroeconomic time series obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and Statistics South Africa (STATSSA) and updated on a weekly basis via EconData and automated scraping of the SARB and STATSSA websites. I hosted it on servers at Codera Analytics, implemented the updating through GitHub Actions, and created the samadb R package for easy access. As of January 2026, the weekly updates still run, and the R package enjoys almost 15,000 downloads per month. I also wrote Python and Julia packages as these languages were more popular in the department. With the database in place, I took a deep-dive on DFMs for nowcasting applications, revisiting the workshop materials by Michele Modugno, carefully reading Banbura and Modugno (2014), and looking at various nowcasting codes. The theoretical vignette, published in March 2023, is a result of this deep-dive and was principally written to assist my own understanding. I started implementing some of the features described there, and also received the rOpenSci software reviews during this time, which helped me improve the package. I released dfms 0.2.0, adding autoregressive errors and various smaller improvements, to CRAN at the end of March 2023. I mention in the news for that release that “I plan to implement all features described in this vignette until summer 2023”, but that turned out to be highly optimistic. With one month to go in my research visit, it dawned on me that I wouldn’t be able to complete dfms and build a nowcasting model in good time. Thus, I switched to Python, where Chad Fulton had done some excellent work implementing the DynamicFactorMQ class for mixed-frequency nowcasting in statsmodels alongside a comprehensive tutorial. Following selection of a set of indicators for nowcasting, integration with the database and running the model on a weekly basis—also implemented through GitHub Actions—went quite smoothly. I presented the database, model, and model evaluation results at the Bureau of Economic Research seminar in Stellenbosch on April 20. It was a great success, with additional staff from the Reserve Bank, Treasury, and Statistics South Africa joining online. Afterwards, and as announced in the slides, I devoted the rest of my time and also some time in April/May to the development of a NY-Fed-style Nowcasting Dashboard hosted through Codera Analytics at nowcast.codera.co.za and published in May 2023. Built with Dash and Plotly in Python, it provides interactive visualizations of the nowcast evolution and the data releases driving it, as well as historical nowcasting performance and release impacts by sector. This South Africa Nowcasting Model ran until November 2024, when it broke down due to the unavailability of some time series. So that is also a warning right there—if you are building a nowcasting platform using dfms or other tools, make sure you have a robust data pipeline in place and only include series that will remain available for years. With the nowcasting platform in place, and the initial software reviews completed, there was not much urgency to work more on dfms. I had shifted my research interests to infrastructure and value chains in Africa, and was busy with other projects. rOpenSci editors kept pinging me in 2024 for the resubmit, but I was wrapping up my PhD, and also still had the ambition to implement mixed-frequency features. This state dragged on for a while after the PhD defense (Nov’24) as I was consulting, job-searching, and doing other things, but I managed, in May 2025, to push out dfms 0.3.0 with the mixed-frequency DFM implementation and resubmitted it to rOpenSci. The reviewers approved, and, given that it was to be published through rOpenSci in January 2026, I forced myself to complete the scope of the package. I thus spent two intense weekends and pushed out dfms 0.4.0, adding support for mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors, on January 18, followed by this monumental 1.0.0 release, including the news decomposition following Banbura and Modugno (2014), full-state predictions, a package logo and updated practical vignette, on January 26. The package was then published through rOpenSci, which means the repo moved to rOpenSci GitHub and its docs are served from docs.ropensci.org. The final push was greatly facilitated by the availability of modern AI, in particular Cursor and the Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 Codex models, which could take into context Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s original Matlab code and their paper + appendix, and help make and execute detailed implementation plans. I tested these by translating the Matlab code to Julia and testing it against R—using the Cursor debugger to hunt down complicated bugs. This thus concludes the story of dfms—from simple single-frequency package to a full-blown DFM/nowcasting library in four years. Apart from some differences in design choices, Kalman Filter initialization, and reporting, the package produces identical results to Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s research codes. The literature on DFMs has, of course, moved on—with regime switching/time-varying volatility/parameter Bayesian DFMs now the state of the art.2 Since the state of the art is complicated and computationally intense though, and the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) works very well when shocks are moderate—we also tested the DFM against various ML/DL based approaches on US data, including the COVID shock, and found that it outperformed most ML/DL methods—I believe dfms 1.0+ can serve the community well, and I hope that it will find use in academia and policy institutions.

The literature on DFMs has, of course, moved on—with regime switching/time-varying volatility/parameter Bayesian DFMs now the state of the art.2 Since the state of the art is complicated and computationally intense though, and the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) works very well when shocks are moderate—we also tested the DFM against various ML/DL based approaches on US data, including the COVID shock, and found that it outperformed most ML/DL methods—I believe dfms 1.0+ can serve the community well, and I hope that it will find use in academia and policy institutions. New dfms Features: Mixed Frequency DFMs with Autoregressive Errors, Full-State Predictions, and Multi-Target News Decomposition The two latest dfms updates principally introduce three new features: (1) mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors implemented in dfms 0.4.0; (2) decomposition of forecast revisions into news contributions following Banbura and Modugno (2014), and (3) full-state predictions and forecasts implemented in dfms 1.0.0. To stick with the context of its history, and since the documentation and vignette provide lots of examples using the included dataset of Banbura and Modugno (2014), I will re-estimate my South Africa nowcasting model with the last available vintages for end-November and early-December 2024. library(fastverse) ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 -- ## v data.table 1.17.0 v kit 0.0.21 ## v magrittr 2.0.4 v collapse 2.1.6 fastverse_extend(xts, dfms, readxl) ## -- Attaching extension packages --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 -- ## v xts 0.14.1 v readxl 1.4.5 ## v dfms 1.0.0 ## -- Conflicts ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse_conflicts() -- ## x xts::first() masks data.table::first() ## x xts::last() masks data.table::last() ## x dfms::news() masks utils::news() # Get Last November 2024 Vintage download.file(\"https://github.com/coderaanalytics-models/SA-Nowcast/raw/refs/heads/main/vintages/econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", destfile = \"econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", mode = \"wb\") data_m qDT() |> as.xts() ncol(data_m) ## [1] 54 data_q qDT() |> fmutate(date = as.Date(date)) |> # dfms expects quarterly data to be released on the 3rd month of each quarter within(lubridate::month(date) as.xts() colnames(data_q) ## [1] \"UNEMP\" \"GDP\" \"RGDP\" # The xts data format makes temporal merging and subsetting very easy data",

    "main_text": "Releasing dfms 1.0: Fast and Feature-Rich Estimation of Dynamic Factor Models in R\nPosted on\nJanuary 28, 2026\nby\nR, Econometrics, High Performance\nin\nR bloggers\n| 0 Comments\n[This article was first published on\nR, Econometrics, High Performance\n, and kindly contributed to\nR-bloggers\n].  (You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nI am very happy to announce the release of\ndfms\nversion 1.0\n(and 0.4.0 just a week earlier, see\nnews\n), implementing major features such as support for dynamic factor models (DFMs) with autoregressive errors, mixed-frequency (monthly-quarterly) DFMs, including with autoregressive errors, and decomposition of forecast revisions into news releases (updates to time series) following Banbura and Modugno (2014)—supporting interpretable nowcasts for one or multiple monthly or quarterly targets. This completes the planned scope of the package: the full, computationally efficient, and easily accessible implementation of the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) in R.\nTogether with this major release,\ndfms\nhas now been successfully peer-reviewed by two academic reviewers through the\nrOpenSci\nSoftware Peer Review\n, and was published by rOpenSci—the repo now lives at\ngithub.com/ropensci/dfms\nand the website at\ndocs.ropensci.org/dfms\n(redirects are in place).\ndfms\n1.0 thus provides a feature-rich, easy-to-use, computationally efficient (C++ powered), and verified toolset to estimate and work with DFMs in R. It also seamlessly integrates with the R language and its common methods and design patterns for statistical packages. It is well documented via a\ntheoretical\nand\npractical\nvignette and detailed function\ndocumentation\n, and thus offers an excellent entry point for young researchers and practitioners interested in DFMs and nowcasting. I therefore hope that its uptake within the scientific and R communities will increase.\nThe release also marks a major milestone for a package that was first put on CRAN in October 2022 to estimate a simple, single frequency DFM—especially given that I don’t sit in a Central Bank or do macro/business cycle analysis for a living. I also never had a natural fascination for Kalman Filters. Rather, a series of professional coincidences over the course of 5 years eventually culminated in this package. I thus want to briefly reflect on the history of\ndfms\nbefore I demonstrate its new features.\nThe Story of\ndfms\n: From Simple Beginnings to Fully-Featured DFM Package\nAs an economist training in macroeconomics, trade, and development, I got to know about DFMs almost by accident during my Master’s in Geneva at a summer school on “Big Data in Macroeconomics and Finance” at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in 2018—which also marks my first encounter with the Kiel Institute where I ended up doing my PhD. The course covered a variety of topics via external lecturers: household finance, social networks, geospatial big data, text mining, and also a day of “Nowcasting” with Michele Modugno from the Federal Reserve Board—where he presented his mixed-frequency DFM methodology that\ndfms\nnow efficiently implements in R and C++. I didn’t understand much of it back then and was more interested in the other topics, but I had gotten the gist of it.\nFollowing my Master’s, I was posted to Uganda as an ODI Fellow on a 2-year assignment (2020/21) in the Macroeconomic Policy Department of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MoFPED). Most of my work involved financial programming, data science, and other kinds of econometric and CGE analysis. In spring 2021, I was, however, working part-time on a research paper on\nMacroeconomic Dynamics and the Effects of Fiscal Spending in Uganda\n. Its aim was to assess the dynamic impact of fiscal spending on the Ugandan economy and answer a few critical questions that kept coming up, such as are we crowding out credit to the private sector? What happens to interest/tbill rates when we spend more? and what is the economic/growth impact of our spending? Annual time series in Uganda are relatively short, but we observed fiscal spending and a few other key indicators on a monthly basis. Putting together a monthly estimation dataset was thus key for meaningful dynamic modelling.\nThe main monthly indicator of economic activity in Uganda with some history is the\nComposite Index of Economic Activity (CIEA)\npublished by the Bank of Uganda. It combines 10 monthly series: real currency in circulation, real VAT on domestic goods, real exports of goods and services, real imports, real government expenditure, real sales of selected companies, real cement production, real excise taxes, real PAYE and real private sector credit. They are combined by first using the Henderson Moving Average procedure for seasonal adjustment and separation of irregular components, and aggregation of the trend-cycle series into a composite trend-cycle indicator using weights derived from PCA and correlations of series with quarterly GDP.\nAnd that is where my problem was—the inclusion of real government expenditure in this index defeated my purposes of using it to assess fiscal spending impacts. I thus needed an index without it, and I also thought the removal of irregular components and complicated aggregation procedure was suboptimal for research purposes. I wanted a simple, transparent procedure to obtain a monthly indicator of economic activity for Uganda, and a basic DFM with a single factor seemed the appropriate\n\\[\\textbf{x}_t = \\textbf{c} f_t + \\textbf{e}_t \\ \\sim\\  N(\\textbf{0}, \\textbf{R})\\]\n\\[f_t = \\sum_{j=1}^p a_j f_{t-j} + u_t \\ \\sim\\  N(0, q)\\]\nmethodology—with observation weights\nc\nand transition coefficients\n\\(a_j\\)\nto be jointly estimated.\nSo I looked for a simple implementation of DFMs and found, on GitHub, the R package\ndynfactoR\nby Rtys Bagduzinas that estimated single-frequency DFMs with the EM/QML algorithm following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2012), and also produced PCA and 2-step estimates following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2011). It used a Julia backend for some of the filters, thus I\nforked it\nand made some changes—rewriting the Kalman Filter and Smoother and some parts of the EM algorithm in\nArmadillo C++\n, and linking through Rcpp. The package served the purposes of my paper well, and I had thought of creating something more organized and releasing it to CRAN, but didn’t follow through at that point (2021) as I was wrapping up my assignment in Uganda.\nI returned to dynfactoR a year later in the early stages of my PhD—still working on empirical macroeconomics in Africa—and managed to refactor the package and put a first version on CRAN. For this refactor, I took much inspiration from the excellent\nvars\npackage to estimate (S)VAR and (S)VEC models in R, which provides a compelling nomenclature with main function\nVAR()\nand tight observance of the object-oriented conventions for statistical R packages—including\nprint()\n,\nplot()\n,\ncoef()\n,\nsummary()\n,\nresiduals()\n,\nfitted()\n,\npredict()\n, and\nlogLik()\nmethods for the\nvarest\nobjects returned by\nVAR()\n, and various other methods, e.g.,\nprint()\nand\nplot()\nfor the\nvarprd\nobjects returned by\npredict()\n. It also provides information criteria to select the VAR lag order via\nVARselect()\n. Furthermore, its function documentation includes mathematical formulations alongside brief explanations, which I liked a lot. I thus got inspired and called the package\ndfms\n, with main function\nDFM()\n, implemented information criteria to select the number of factors\nr\nfollowing Bai and Ng (2002) in\nICr()\n, including a\nscreeplot()\nmethod following Onatski (2010),\n1\nand a comprehensive set of methods like\nvars\n. I also exported the C++ Kalman Filter and Smoother—which to my knowledge is still the most efficient implementation in R—alongside the function\ntsnarmimp()\nto impute time series matrices using cubic splines and moving averages (needed internally to obtain initial PCA-based system matrices to initialize the Kalman Filter), and Armadillo’s inverse and pseudo-inverse functions which I found somewhat more robust than R’s native ones.\ndfms\nversion 0.1.3\n, including these features, hit CRAN in October 2022, and I introduced it with a brief\nblog post\n. I also\nsubmitted it\nfor the\nrOpenSci\nSoftware Peer Review\nas I thought that might increase its quality.\nIt then occurred, one year into the PhD, that I was getting a bit bored in Kiel during the winter of 2022/23, and, through connections, organized myself a 3-month research visit at Stellenbosch University in South Africa—from February-April 2023. Parts of the department were very interested in nowcasting the South African economy. They had attempted it with regression and ML-based approaches, but, given my\ndfms\npackage on CRAN, they asked me to work on an interpretable DFM-based methodology. This interest in nowcasting was warranted as, in the spring of 2023, the\nSouth African energy crisis\nwas at its peak, with the implementation of load-shedding level 6—which meant about 8 hours per day on generators—inducing justified fears that it would stifle the South African economy.\nThus, I set out to implement a mixed-frequency DFM to nowcast the South African economy, particularly real GDP and unemployment. The first step, which took up much of my time, was to assemble and automate a database of high quality macroeconomic indicators. I ended up creating the\nSouth Africa Macroeconomic Database (SAMADB)\n—an open relational database with ~10,000 macroeconomic time series obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and Statistics South Africa (STATSSA) and updated on a weekly basis via\nEconData\nand automated scraping of the\nSARB\nand\nSTATSSA\nwebsites. I hosted it on servers at\nCodera Analytics\n, implemented the updating through GitHub Actions, and created the\nsamadb\nR package for easy access. As of January 2026, the weekly updates still run, and the R package enjoys almost 15,000 downloads per month. I also wrote\nPython\nand\nJulia\npackages as these languages were more popular in the department.\nWith the database in place, I took a deep-dive on DFMs for nowcasting applications, revisiting the workshop materials by Michele Modugno, carefully reading Banbura and Modugno (2014), and looking at various nowcasting codes. The\ntheoretical vignette\n, published in March 2023, is a result of this deep-dive and was principally written to assist my own understanding. I started implementing some of the features described there, and also received the rOpenSci software reviews during this time, which helped me improve the package. I released\ndfms\n0.2.0\n, adding autoregressive errors and various smaller improvements, to CRAN at the end of March 2023. I mention in the\nnews\nfor that release that “I plan to implement all features described in this vignette until summer 2023”, but that turned out to be highly optimistic. With one month to go in my research visit, it dawned on me that I wouldn’t be able to complete\ndfms\nand build a nowcasting model in good time.\nThus, I switched to Python, where Chad Fulton had done some excellent work implementing the\nDynamicFactorMQ\nclass for mixed-frequency nowcasting in\nstatsmodels\nalongside a\ncomprehensive tutorial\n. Following selection of a set of indicators for nowcasting, integration with the database and running the model on a weekly basis—also\nimplemented through GitHub Actions\n—went quite smoothly. I\npresented\nthe database, model, and model evaluation results at the\nBureau of Economic Research\nseminar in Stellenbosch on April 20. It was a great success, with additional staff from the Reserve Bank, Treasury, and Statistics South Africa joining online.\nAfterwards, and as announced in the\nslides\n, I devoted the rest of my time and also some time in April/May to the development of a\nNY-Fed-style Nowcasting Dashboard\nhosted through Codera Analytics at\nnowcast.codera.co.za\nand published in May 2023.\nBuilt\nwith\nDash\nand\nPlotly\nin Python, it provides interactive visualizations of the nowcast evolution and the data releases driving it, as well as historical nowcasting performance and release impacts by sector. This\nSouth Africa Nowcasting Model\nran until November 2024, when it broke down due to the unavailability of some time series. So that is also a warning right there—if you are building a nowcasting platform using\ndfms\nor other tools, make sure you have a robust data pipeline in place and only include series that will remain available for years.\nWith the nowcasting platform in place, and the initial software reviews completed, there was not much urgency to work more on\ndfms\n. I had shifted my research interests to infrastructure and value chains in Africa, and was busy with other projects. rOpenSci editors kept pinging me in 2024 for the resubmit, but I was wrapping up my PhD, and also still had the ambition to implement mixed-frequency features. This state dragged on for a while after the PhD defense (Nov’24) as I was consulting, job-searching, and doing other things, but I managed, in May 2025, to push out\ndfms\n0.3.0\nwith the mixed-frequency DFM implementation and resubmitted it to rOpenSci. The reviewers approved, and, given that it was to be published through rOpenSci in January 2026, I forced myself to complete the scope of the package. I thus spent two intense weekends and pushed out\ndfms\n0.4.0\n, adding support for mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors, on January 18, followed by this monumental\n1.0.0 release\n, including the news decomposition following Banbura and Modugno (2014), full-state predictions, a\npackage logo\nand updated\npractical vignette\n, on January 26. The package was then published through rOpenSci, which means the\nrepo\nmoved to rOpenSci GitHub and its\ndocs\nare served from docs.ropensci.org.\nThe final push was greatly facilitated by the availability of modern AI, in particular Cursor and the Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 Codex models, which could take into context Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s original\nMatlab code\nand their paper + appendix, and help make and execute detailed implementation plans. I tested these by translating the Matlab code to\nJulia\nand testing it against R—using the Cursor debugger to hunt down complicated bugs.\nThis thus concludes the story of\ndfms\n—from simple single-frequency package to a full-blown DFM/nowcasting library in four years. Apart from some differences in design choices, Kalman Filter initialization, and reporting, the package produces identical results to Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s research codes.\nThe literature on DFMs has, of course, moved on—with regime switching/time-varying volatility/parameter Bayesian DFMs now the state of the art.\n2\nSince the state of the art is complicated and computationally intense though, and the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) works very well when shocks are moderate—we also\ntested the DFM against various ML/DL based approaches on US data\n, including the COVID shock, and\nfound\nthat it outperformed most ML/DL methods—I believe\ndfms\n1.0+ can serve the community well, and I hope that it will find use in academia and policy institutions.\nNew\ndfms\nFeatures: Mixed Frequency DFMs with Autoregressive Errors, Full-State Predictions, and Multi-Target News Decomposition\nThe two latest\ndfms\nupdates principally introduce three new features: (1) mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors implemented in\ndfms\n0.4.0; (2) decomposition of forecast revisions into news contributions following Banbura and Modugno (2014), and (3) full-state predictions and forecasts implemented in\ndfms\n1.0.0.\nTo stick with the context of its history, and since the\ndocumentation\nand\nvignette\nprovide lots of examples using the included dataset of Banbura and Modugno (2014), I will re-estimate my South Africa nowcasting model with the last available vintages for end-November and early-December 2024.\nlibrary(fastverse)\n## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 --\n## v data.table 1.17.0     v kit        0.0.21\n## v magrittr   2.0.4      v collapse   2.1.6\nfastverse_extend(xts, dfms, readxl)\n## -- Attaching extension packages --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse 0.3.4 --\n## v xts    0.14.1     v readxl 1.4.5 \n## v dfms   1.0.0\n## -- Conflicts ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- fastverse_conflicts() --\n## x xts::first() masks data.table::first()\n## x xts::last()  masks data.table::last()\n## x dfms::news() masks utils::news()\n# Get Last November 2024 Vintage\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/coderaanalytics-models/SA-Nowcast/raw/refs/heads/main/vintages/econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\",\n              destfile = \"econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", mode = \"wb\")\ndata_m <- read_xlsx(\"econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", \n                    sheet = \"data_logdiff_m\") |> qDT() |> as.xts()\nncol(data_m)\n## [1] 54\ndata_q <- read_xlsx(\"econdata_nowcast_data_22_11_2024.xlsx\", \n                    sheet = \"data_logdiff_q\") |> qDT() |> \n  fmutate(date = as.Date(date)) |> \n  # dfms expects quarterly data to be released on the 3rd month of each quarter\n  within(lubridate::month(date) <- lubridate::month(date) + 2L) |> as.xts()\ncolnames(data_q)\n## [1] \"UNEMP\" \"GDP\"   \"RGDP\"\n# The xts data format makes temporal merging and subsetting very easy\ndata <- merge(data_m, data_q)[\"1990-02/\"]\n# .. it also has a nice plot method\nplot(scale(data), lwd = 1, ylim = c(-5, 5))\nThe usual\ndfms\nworkflow is starts with information criteria to determine the number of factors and the factor-VAR order\n(ic <- ICr(data))\n## Missing values detected: imputing data with tsnarmimp() with default settings\n## Optimal Number of Factors (r) from Bai and Ng (2002) Criteria\n## \n## IC1 IC2 IC3 \n##   1   1  20\nscreeplot(ic)\nvars::VARselect(ic$F_pca[, 1:4])\n## $selection\n## AIC(n)  HQ(n)  SC(n) FPE(n) \n##      7      3      3      7 \n## \n## $criteria\n##                1         2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9       10\n## AIC(n)  3.372492  2.959518 1.718657 1.667090 1.668591 1.636513 1.606690 1.618062 1.652979 1.673131\n## HQ(n)   3.450602  3.100117 1.921743 1.932665 1.996653 2.027064 2.059729 2.133589 2.230994 2.313634\n## SC(n)   3.569849  3.314762 2.231786 2.338105 2.497491 2.623300 2.751363 2.920620 3.113423 3.291460\n## FPE(n) 29.151229 19.289241 5.577523 5.297771 5.306648 5.140434 4.991144 5.050561 5.233119 5.343569\nSince the data includes the COVID shock, the first principal component is very dominant, and the information criteria suggest 1 factor. However, since the screeplot drops a bit after the 4th eigenvalue, I opt for four factors, also given that series from the four sectors—real, financial, fiscal, and external—are represented in the dataset. The VAR order is selected as 3 by the HQ and SC criteria. I thus estimate the DFM with 4 factors and VAR(3) dynamics, including autoregressive errors of order 1 and an adjusted state-space form where quarterly variables are represented by unobserved monthly counterparts following Mariano and Murasawa (2003). Importantly for the later news decomposition, setting\nmax.missing = 1\nprevents further rows from being dropped from the estimation dataset.\n3\nThese two features increase the size of the state-space, and thus computation time, a lot compared to simple estimation (which takes just 2 seconds), but the robust C++ backend still delivers a very respectable computation time of less than one minute for this most complex model case.\nsystem.time(DFM(data, r = 4, p = 3, max.missing = 1))\n## Converged after 33 iterations.\n##    user  system elapsed \n##   1.373   0.046   1.421\nsystem.time({\ndfm <- DFM(data, r = 4, p = 3, idio.ar1 = TRUE, max.missing = 1,\n           quarterly.vars = colnames(data_q))\n})\n## Converged after 26 iterations.\n##    user  system elapsed \n##  32.635   0.533  33.225\nsummary(dfm)\n## Mixed Frequency Dynamic Factor Model\n## n = 57, nm = 54, nq = 3, T = 417, r = 4, p = 3\n## %NA = 26.2695, %NAm = 23.8209\n##    with AR(1) errors: mean(abs(rho)) = 0.296 \n## \n## Call:  DFM(X = data, r = 4, p = 3, max.missing = 1, idio.ar1 = TRUE,      quarterly.vars = colnames(data_q))\n## \n## Summary Statistics of Factors [F]\n##       N    Mean  Median      SD       Min      Max\n## f1  417  0.0358  0.0224  3.1427  -54.3033  25.3044\n## f2  417  0.0148  0.0358  1.5887   -19.842     21.7\n## f3  417  0.0464  0.0729  1.6763  -25.5152  12.9381\n## f4  417  0.0239  0.0049  1.1397   -8.1336  12.0924\n## \n## Factor Transition Matrix [A]\n##       L1.f1   L1.f2   L1.f3   L1.f4     L2.f1    L2.f2   L2.f3   L2.f4   L3.f1    L3.f2    L3.f3    L3.f4\n## f1 -0.47917 -0.4016 1.49438  0.4893 -0.970167 -0.64590  0.2723 -0.4588 -0.4225 -0.10730 -0.12302 -0.37666\n## f2  0.07605 -0.4483 0.05939  0.1679 -0.008145 -0.30928  0.2850  0.1486  0.2977 -0.12425 -0.08882 -0.13348\n## f3  0.42230  0.2774 0.02289  0.5551  0.080860 -0.02339 -0.4085  0.1032  0.1769  0.10793 -0.07216  0.10206\n## f4  0.16261  0.1108 0.12947 -0.2689  0.005231  0.10899  0.1003 -0.3174  0.2039 -0.02751 -0.12524 -0.07243\n## \n## Factor Covariance Matrix [cov(F)]\n##           f1        f2        f3        f4\n## f1   9.8763   -0.1549    0.2107    0.2422 \n## f2  -0.1549    2.5241    0.1329    0.9066*\n## f3   0.2107    0.1329    2.8101    0.4524*\n## f4   0.2422    0.9066*   0.4524*   1.2990 \n## \n## Factor Transition Error Covariance Matrix [Q]\n##        u1      u2     u3      u4\n## u1 7.6784  0.1027 0.9381  0.7389\n## u2 0.1027  0.2946 0.1342 -0.2394\n## u3 0.9381  0.1342 0.4943  0.1539\n## u4 0.7389 -0.2394 0.1539  0.7417\n## \n## Summary of Residual AR(1) Serial Correlations\n##    N     Mean   Median      SD      Min     Max\n##   57  -0.1739  -0.2529  0.2912  -0.6048  0.4128\n## \n## Summary of Individual R-Squared's\n##    N    Mean  Median      SD      Min     Max\n##   57  0.5093  0.5816  0.3811  -0.0188  0.9995\nplot(dfm, xlim = c(200, 415))\nplot(dfm, type = \"individual\", method = \"all\")\nThe factor model is, ostensibly, heavily impacted by the COVID shock, although the extent to which this shock introduced error in the model parameters is not clear. For this demonstration at least, I will not modify the data to deal with the shock. Ostensibly, a significant amount of series still display autoregressive dynamics at\nmean(abs(rho)) = 0.3\n, with autoregressive parameters\n\\(\\rho\\)\nranging from -0.6 to 0.41. As further described in the\ntheoretical vignette\n, the model with autoregressive errors not only estimates these\n\\(\\rho\\)\nparameters for each series—saved in\ndfm$rho\n—but also the error series\n\\(e_t\\)\nitself—saved in\ndfm$e\n—which are modeled as part of the state vector along with the factors. This implies that for these models one can make predictions using either the full state including the modeled residual values or using just the factors. The difference, in this case, is vast, with modeled residuals giving a much better fit to the data.\n# Computing residual absolute ratio in percentage terms\nrarp <- fmedian(abs(resid(dfm))) / fmedian(abs(resid(dfm, use.full.state = FALSE))) * 100\ndescr(rarp)\n## Dataset: rarp, 1 Variables, N = 57\n## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n## rarp (numeric): \n## Statistics\n##    N  Ndist  Mean    SD   Min  Max  Skew  Kurt\n##   57     57  0.04  0.06  0.01  0.3  2.41  8.89\n## Quantiles\n##     1%    5%   10%   25%   50%   75%   90%   95%   99%\n##   0.01  0.01  0.01  0.01  0.02  0.05  0.13  0.16  0.27\n## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhile using the full state (the new default) changes the interpretation of in-sample residuals and fitted values, it generally slightly improves the accuracy of dynamic predictions obtainable with\npredict()\n.\nplot(predict(dfm), xlim = c(400, 428), ylim = c(-2, 2))\nNow, the main addition in\ndfms\n1.0, as mentioned, is the news decomposition via\nnews()\n. For this we first need to load the latest vintage and set it to the same range.\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/coderaanalytics-models/SA-Nowcast/raw/refs/heads/main/vintages/econdata_nowcast_data_03_12_2024.xlsx\",\n              destfile = \"econdata_nowcast_data_03_12_2024.xlsx\", mode = \"wb\")\ndata_m_dec <- read_xlsx(\"econdata_nowcast_data_03_12_2024.xlsx\", sheet = \"data_logdiff_m\") |>\n  qDT() |> as.xts()\ndata_q_dec <- read_xlsx(\"econdata_nowcast_data_03_12_2024.xlsx\", sheet = \"data_logdiff_q\") |>\n  qDT() |> fmutate(date = as.Date(date)) |> within(lubridate::month(date) <- lubridate::month(date) + 2L) |> as.xts()\ndata_dec <- merge(data_m_dec, data_q_dec)[\"1990-02/2024-10\"]\nWe could then either estimate a second DFM using this vintage and pass both model objects to\nnews()\n, or simply pass the new vintage dataset to\nnews()\nand it will internally estimate a second DFM of the exact same specification. The function supports one or multiple targets and, by default, chooses the last period in the dataset as the nowcasting target period.\nnews_res <- news(dfm, data_dec, target.vars = colnames(data_q))\n## Converged after 26 iterations.\nprint(news_res)      # Multiple targets -> dfm_news_list object\n## DFM News (Multiple Targets)\n## Target time: 417 \n## Targets: 3 \n## Standardized: FALSE \n##         y_old   y_new revision\n## UNEMP -0.4463 -3.2878  -2.8415\n## GDP    1.5853  2.0275   0.4421\n## RGDP   0.0134  0.4465   0.4332\nprint(news_res$RGDP) # Single target -> dfm_news object\n## DFM News\n## Target variable: RGDP \n## Target time: 417 \n## Old forecast: 0.0134 \n## New forecast: 0.4465 \n## Revision: 0.4332 \n## Standardized: FALSE\n# Target period: \nindex(data)[417]\n## [1] \"2024-10-01 UTC\"\n# Basically this is our prediction of RGDP if it were measured \n# across August-October 2024.

Nevertheless, the package now provides a full, efficient, and user-friendly implementation of the Banbura and Modugno (2014) methodology in R—which remains the baseline as far as linear Gaussian factor and nowcasting models are concerned. I thus hope that it will be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in DFMs and nowcasting.\nReferences\nDoz, C., Giannone, D., & Reichlin, L. (2011).

This completes the planned scope of the package: the full, computationally efficient, and easily accessible implementation of the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) in R.</p>\n<p>Together with this major release, <em>dfms</em> has now been successfully peer-reviewed by two academic reviewers through the <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">rOpenSci</a> <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/software-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Software Peer Review</a>, and was published by rOpenSci—the repo now lives at <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/dfms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><code>github.com/ropensci/dfms</code></a> and the website at <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">docs.ropensci.org/dfms</a> (redirects are in place).</p>\n<p><em>dfms</em> 1.0 thus provides a feature-rich, easy-to-use, computationally efficient (C++ powered), and verified toolset to estimate and work with DFMs in R. It also seamlessly integrates with the R language and its common methods and design patterns for statistical packages. It is well documented via a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/dfms/main/vignettes/dynamic_factor_models_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">theoretical</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/articles/introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">practical</a> vignette and detailed function <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/reference/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>, and thus offers an excellent entry point for young researchers and practitioners interested in DFMs and nowcasting. I therefore hope that its uptake within the scientific and R communities will increase.</p>\n<p>The release also marks a major milestone for a package that was first put on CRAN in October 2022 to estimate a simple, single frequency DFM—especially given that I don’t sit in a Central Bank or do macro/business cycle analysis for a living. I also never had a natural fascination for Kalman Filters. Rather, a series of professional coincidences over the course of 5 years eventually culminated in this package. I thus want to briefly reflect on the history of <em>dfms</em> before I demonstrate its new features.</p>\n<div class=\"section level2\" id=\"the-story-of-dfms-from-simple-beginnings-to-fully-featured-dfm-package\">\n<h2>The Story of <em>dfms</em>: From Simple Beginnings to Fully-Featured DFM Package</h2>\n<p>As an economist training in macroeconomics, trade, and development, I got to know about DFMs almost by accident during my Master’s in Geneva at a summer school on “Big Data in Macroeconomics and Finance” at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in 2018—which also marks my first encounter with the Kiel Institute where I ended up doing my PhD. The course covered a variety of topics via external lecturers: household finance, social networks, geospatial big data, text mining, and also a day of “Nowcasting” with Michele Modugno from the Federal Reserve Board—where he presented his mixed-frequency DFM methodology that <em>dfms</em> now efficiently implements in R and C++. I didn’t understand much of it back then and was more interested in the other topics, but I had gotten the gist of it.</p>\n<p>Following my Master’s, I was posted to Uganda as an ODI Fellow on a 2-year assignment (2020/21) in the Macroeconomic Policy Department of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development (MoFPED). Most of my work involved financial programming, data science, and other kinds of econometric and CGE analysis. In spring 2021, I was, however, working part-time on a research paper on <a href=\"https://sebastiankrantz.com/research.html#uganda-fiscal-spending\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Macroeconomic Dynamics and the Effects of Fiscal Spending in Uganda</a>. Its aim was to assess the dynamic impact of fiscal spending on the Ugandan economy and answer a few critical questions that kept coming up, such as are we crowding out credit to the private sector? What happens to interest/tbill rates when we spend more? and what is the economic/growth impact of our spending? Annual time series in Uganda are relatively short, but we observed fiscal spending and a few other key indicators on a monthly basis. Putting together a monthly estimation dataset was thus key for meaningful dynamic modelling.</p>\n<p>The main monthly indicator of economic activity in Uganda with some history is the <a href=\"https://bou.or.ug/bouwebsite/bouwebsitecontent/research/BoUworkingPapers/research/BouWorkingPapers/2012/Composite_Indicator_of_Economic_Activity_for_Uganda._BOUWP0612.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Composite Index of Economic Activity (CIEA)</a> published by the Bank of Uganda. It combines 10 monthly series: real currency in circulation, real VAT on domestic goods, real exports of goods and services, real imports, real government expenditure, real sales of selected companies, real cement production, real excise taxes, real PAYE and real private sector credit. They are combined by first using the Henderson Moving Average procedure for seasonal adjustment and separation of irregular components, and aggregation of the trend-cycle series into a composite trend-cycle indicator using weights derived from PCA and correlations of series with quarterly GDP.</p>\n<p>And that is where my problem was—the inclusion of real government expenditure in this index defeated my purposes of using it to assess fiscal spending impacts. I thus needed an index without it, and I also thought the removal of irregular components and complicated aggregation procedure was suboptimal for research purposes. I wanted a simple, transparent procedure to obtain a monthly indicator of economic activity for Uganda, and a basic DFM with a single factor seemed the appropriate</p>\n<p><span class=\"math display\">\\[\\textbf{x}_t = \\textbf{c} f_t + \\textbf{e}_t \\ \\sim\\  N(\\textbf{0}, \\textbf{R})\\]</span>\n<span class=\"math display\">\\[f_t = \\sum_{j=1}^p a_j f_{t-j} + u_t \\ \\sim\\  N(0, q)\\]</span></p>\n<p>methodology—with observation weights <strong>c</strong> and transition coefficients <span class=\"math inline\">\\(a_j\\)</span> to be jointly estimated.</p>\n<p>So I looked for a simple implementation of DFMs and found, on GitHub, the R package <a href=\"https://github.com/rbagd/dynfactoR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">dynfactoR</a> by Rtys Bagduzinas that estimated single-frequency DFMs with the EM/QML algorithm following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2012), and also produced PCA and 2-step estimates following Doz, Giannone, and Reichlin (2011). It used a Julia backend for some of the filters, thus I <a href=\"https://github.com/SebKrantz/dynfacto_R\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">forked it</a> and made some changes—rewriting the Kalman Filter and Smoother and some parts of the EM algorithm in <a href=\"https://arma.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Armadillo C++</a>, and linking through Rcpp. The package served the purposes of my paper well, and I had thought of creating something more organized and releasing it to CRAN, but didn’t follow through at that point (2021) as I was wrapping up my assignment in Uganda.</p>\n<p>I returned to dynfactoR a year later in the early stages of my PhD—still working on empirical macroeconomics in Africa—and managed to refactor the package and put a first version on CRAN. For this refactor, I took much inspiration from the excellent <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/package=vars\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">vars</a> package to estimate (S)VAR and (S)VEC models in R, which provides a compelling nomenclature with main function <code>VAR()</code> and tight observance of the object-oriented conventions for statistical R packages—including <code>print()</code>, <code>plot()</code>, <code>coef()</code>, <code>summary()</code>, <code>residuals()</code>, <code>fitted()</code>, <code>predict()</code>, and <code>logLik()</code> methods for the <em>varest</em> objects returned by <code>VAR()</code>, and various other methods, e.g., <code>print()</code> and <code>plot()</code> for the <em>varprd</em> objects returned by <code>predict()</code>. It also provides information criteria to select the VAR lag order via <code>VARselect()</code>. Furthermore, its function documentation includes mathematical formulations alongside brief explanations, which I liked a lot. I thus got inspired and called the package <em>dfms</em>, with main function <code>DFM()</code>, implemented information criteria to select the number of factors <code>r</code> following Bai and Ng (2002) in <code>ICr()</code>, including a <code>screeplot()</code> method following Onatski (2010),<a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>1</sup></a> and a comprehensive set of methods like <em>vars</em>. I also exported the C++ Kalman Filter and Smoother—which to my knowledge is still the most efficient implementation in R—alongside the function <code>tsnarmimp()</code> to impute time series matrices using cubic splines and moving averages (needed internally to obtain initial PCA-based system matrices to initialize the Kalman Filter), and Armadillo’s inverse and pseudo-inverse functions which I found somewhat more robust than R’s native ones. <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/news/index.html#dfms-013\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>dfms</em> version 0.1.3</a>, including these features, hit CRAN in October 2022, and I introduced it with a brief <a href=\"https://sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2022/10/22/introducing-dfms-efficient-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>. I also <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/556\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">submitted it</a> for the <em>rOpenSci</em> <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/software-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Software Peer Review</a> as I thought that might increase its quality.</p>\n<p>It then occurred, one year into the PhD, that I was getting a bit bored in Kiel during the winter of 2022/23, and, through connections, organized myself a 3-month research visit at Stellenbosch University in South Africa—from February-April 2023. Parts of the department were very interested in nowcasting the South African economy. They had attempted it with regression and ML-based approaches, but, given my <em>dfms</em> package on CRAN, they asked me to work on an interpretable DFM-based methodology. This interest in nowcasting was warranted as, in the spring of 2023, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_energy_crisis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">South African energy crisis</a> was at its peak, with the implementation of load-shedding level 6—which meant about 8 hours per day on generators—inducing justified fears that it would stifle the South African economy.</p>\n<p>Thus, I set out to implement a mixed-frequency DFM to nowcast the South African economy, particularly real GDP and unemployment. The first step, which took up much of my time, was to assemble and automate a database of high quality macroeconomic indicators. I ended up creating the <a href=\"https://github.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/SAMADB-Issues\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">South Africa Macroeconomic Database (SAMADB)</a>—an open relational database with ~10,000 macroeconomic time series obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and Statistics South Africa (STATSSA) and updated on a weekly basis via <a href=\"https://www.econdata.co.za/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">EconData</a> and automated scraping of the <a href=\"https://www.resbank.co.za/en/home/publications/quarterly-bulletin1/download-information-from-xlsx-data-files\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SARB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.statssa.gov.za/?page_id=1847\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">STATSSA</a> websites. I hosted it on servers at <a href=\"https://codera.co.za/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Codera Analytics</a>, implemented the updating through GitHub Actions, and created the <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/package=samadb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">samadb</a> R package for easy access. As of January 2026, the weekly updates still run, and the R package enjoys almost 15,000 downloads per month. I also wrote <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/samadb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a> and <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/SAMaDB\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Julia</a> packages as these languages were more popular in the department.</p>\n<p>With the database in place, I took a deep-dive on DFMs for nowcasting applications, revisiting the workshop materials by Michele Modugno, carefully reading Banbura and Modugno (2014), and looking at various nowcasting codes. The <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/dfms/main/vignettes/dynamic_factor_models_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">theoretical vignette</a>, published in March 2023, is a result of this deep-dive and was principally written to assist my own understanding. I started implementing some of the features described there, and also received the rOpenSci software reviews during this time, which helped me improve the package. I released <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/news/index.html#dfms-020\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>dfms</em> 0.2.0</a>, adding autoregressive errors and various smaller improvements, to CRAN at the end of March 2023. I mention in the <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/news/index.html#dfms-020\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">news</a> for that release that “I plan to implement all features described in this vignette until summer 2023”, but that turned out to be highly optimistic. With one month to go in my research visit, it dawned on me that I wouldn’t be able to complete <em>dfms</em> and build a nowcasting model in good time.</p>\n<p>Thus, I switched to Python, where Chad Fulton had done some excellent work implementing the <a href=\"https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.dynamic_factor_mq.DynamicFactorMQ.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">DynamicFactorMQ</a> class for mixed-frequency nowcasting in <em>statsmodels</em> alongside a <a href=\"https://www.chadfulton.com/topics/statespace_large_dynamic_factor_models.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive tutorial</a>. Following selection of a set of indicators for nowcasting, integration with the database and running the model on a weekly basis—also <a href=\"https://github.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/SA-Nowcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">implemented through GitHub Actions</a>—went quite smoothly. I <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/SA-Nowcast/main/presentation/SAMADB_Nowcasting.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">presented</a> the database, model, and model evaluation results at the <a href=\"https://www.ber.ac.za/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bureau of Economic Research</a> seminar in Stellenbosch on April 20. It was a great success, with additional staff from the Reserve Bank, Treasury, and Statistics South Africa joining online.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, and as announced in the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/SA-Nowcast/main/presentation/SAMADB_Nowcasting.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">slides</a>, I devoted the rest of my time and also some time in April/May to the development of a <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast/#nowcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">NY-Fed-style Nowcasting Dashboard</a> hosted through Codera Analytics at <a href=\"https://nowcast.codera.co.za/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">nowcast.codera.co.za</a> and published in May 2023. <a href=\"https://github.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/SA-Nowcast/tree/main/app\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Built</a> with <a href=\"https://dash.plotly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dash</a> and <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Plotly</a> in Python, it provides interactive visualizations of the nowcast evolution and the data releases driving it, as well as historical nowcasting performance and release impacts by sector. This <a href=\"https://github.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/SA-Nowcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">South Africa Nowcasting Model</a> ran until November 2024, when it broke down due to the unavailability of some time series. So that is also a warning right there—if you are building a nowcasting platform using <em>dfms</em> or other tools, make sure you have a robust data pipeline in place and only include series that will remain available for years.</p>\n<p>With the nowcasting platform in place, and the initial software reviews completed, there was not much urgency to work more on <em>dfms</em>. I had shifted my research interests to infrastructure and value chains in Africa, and was busy with other projects. rOpenSci editors kept pinging me in 2024 for the resubmit, but I was wrapping up my PhD, and also still had the ambition to implement mixed-frequency features. This state dragged on for a while after the PhD defense (Nov’24) as I was consulting, job-searching, and doing other things, but I managed, in May 2025, to push out <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/news/index.html#dfms-030\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>dfms</em> 0.3.0</a> with the mixed-frequency DFM implementation and resubmitted it to rOpenSci. The reviewers approved, and, given that it was to be published through rOpenSci in January 2026, I forced myself to complete the scope of the package. I thus spent two intense weekends and pushed out <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/news/index.html#dfms-040\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>dfms</em> 0.4.0</a>, adding support for mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors, on January 18, followed by this monumental <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/news/index.html#dfms-100\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1.0.0 release</a>, including the news decomposition following Banbura and Modugno (2014), full-state predictions, a <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/dfms/blob/main/man/figures/logo.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">package logo</a> and updated <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/articles/introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">practical vignette</a>, on January 26. The package was then published through rOpenSci, which means the <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/dfms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">repo</a> moved to rOpenSci GitHub and its <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/dfms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">docs</a> are served from docs.ropensci.org.</p>\n<p>The final push was greatly facilitated by the availability of modern AI, in particular Cursor and the Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 Codex models, which could take into context Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s original <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/dfms/tree/main/misc/BM2014/RepFilesBanburaModugnoJAE14\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Matlab code</a> and their paper + appendix, and help make and execute detailed implementation plans. I tested these by translating the Matlab code to <a href=\"https://github.com/ropensci/dfms/tree/main/misc/BM2014/BM14_Julia\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Julia</a> and testing it against R—using the Cursor debugger to hunt down complicated bugs.</p>\n<p>This thus concludes the story of <em>dfms</em>—from simple single-frequency package to a full-blown DFM/nowcasting library in four years. Apart from some differences in design choices, Kalman Filter initialization, and reporting, the package produces identical results to Banbura and Modugno (2014)’s research codes.</p>\n<p>The literature on DFMs has, of course, moved on—with regime switching/time-varying volatility/parameter Bayesian DFMs now the state of the art.<a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>2</sup></a> Since the state of the art is complicated and computationally intense though, and the methodology of Banbura and Modugno (2014) works very well when shocks are moderate—we also <a href=\"https://github.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/NowcastingUSGDP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tested the DFM against various ML/DL based approaches on US data</a>, including the COVID shock, and <a href=\"https://rawcdn.githack.com/Stellenbosch-Econometrics/NowcastingUSGDP/4ee94e0582b093428d0e242eb723cdf2335f0682/presentation/sem-presentation.html#/title-slide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that it outperformed most ML/DL methods—I believe <em>dfms</em> 1.0+ can serve the community well, and I hope that it will find use in academia and policy institutions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section level2\" id=\"new-dfms-features-mixed-frequency-dfms-with-autoregressive-errors-full-state-predictions-and-multi-target-news-decomposition\">\n<h2>New <em>dfms</em> Features: Mixed Frequency DFMs with Autoregressive Errors, Full-State Predictions, and Multi-Target News Decomposition</h2>\n<p>The two latest <em>dfms</em> updates principally introduce three new features: (1) mixed-frequency estimation with autoregressive errors implemented in <em>dfms</em> 0.4.0;

However, since the screeplot drops a bit after the 4th eigenvalue, I opt for four factors, also given that series from the four sectors—real, financial, fiscal, and external—are represented in the dataset. The VAR order is selected as 3 by the HQ and SC criteria. I thus estimate the DFM with 4 factors and VAR(3) dynamics, including autoregressive errors of order 1 and an adjusted state-space form where quarterly variables are represented by unobserved monthly counterparts following Mariano and Murasawa (2003). Importantly for the later news decomposition, setting <code>max.missing = 1</code> prevents further rows from being dropped from the estimation dataset.<a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"https://sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><sup>3</sup></a> These two features increase the size of the state-space, and thus computation time, a lot compared to simple estimation (which takes just 2 seconds), but the robust C++ backend still delivers a very respectable computation time of less than one minute for this most complex model case.</p>\n<pre>system.time(DFM(data, r = 4, p = 3, max.missing = 1))\n## Converged after 33 iterations.\n##    user  system elapsed \n##   1.373   0.046   1.421\nsystem.time({\ndfm &lt;- DFM(data, r = 4, p = 3, idio.ar1 = TRUE, max.missing = 1,\n           quarterly.vars = colnames(data_q))\n})\n## Converged after 26 iterations.\n##    user  system elapsed \n##  32.635   0.533  33.225\nsummary(dfm)\n## Mixed Frequency Dynamic Factor Model\n## n = 57, nm = 54, nq = 3, T = 417, r = 4, p = 3\n## %NA = 26.2695, %NAm = 23.8209\n##    with AR(1) errors: mean(abs(rho)) = 0.296 \n## \n## Call:  DFM(X = data, r = 4, p = 3, max.missing = 1, idio.ar1 = TRUE,      quarterly.vars = colnames(data_q))\n## \n## Summary Statistics of Factors [F]\n##       N    Mean  Median      SD       Min      Max\n## f1  417  0.0358  0.0224  3.1427  -54.3033  25.3044\n## f2  417  0.0148  0.0358  1.5887   -19.842     21.7\n## f3  417  0.0464  0.0729  1.6763  -25.5152  12.9381\n## f4  417  0.0239  0.0049  1.1397   -8.1336  12.0924\n## \n## Factor Transition Matrix [A]\n##       L1.f1   L1.f2   L1.f3   L1.f4     L2.f1    L2.f2   L2.f3   L2.f4   L3.f1    L3.f2    L3.f3    L3.f4\n## f1 -0.47917 -0.4016 1.49438  0.4893 -0.970167 -0.64590  0.2723 -0.4588 -0.4225 -0.10730 -0.12302 -0.37666\n## f2  0.07605 -0.4483 0.05939  0.1679 -0.008145 -0.30928  0.2850  0.1486  0.2977 -0.12425 -0.08882 -0.13348\n## f3  0.42230  0.2774 0.02289  0.5551  0.080860 -0.02339 -0.4085  0.1032  0.1769  0.10793 -0.07216  0.10206\n## f4  0.16261  0.1108 0.12947 -0.2689  0.005231  0.10899  0.1003 -0.3174  0.2039 -0.02751 -0.12524 -0.07243\n## \n## Factor Covariance Matrix [cov(F)]\n##           f1        f2        f3        f4\n## f1   9.8763   -0.1549    0.2107    0.2422 \n## f2  -0.1549    2.5241    0.1329    0.9066*\n## f3   0.2107    0.1329    2.8101    0.4524*\n## f4   0.2422    0.9066*   0.4524*   1.2990 \n## \n## Factor Transition Error Covariance Matrix [Q]\n##        u1      u2     u3      u4\n## u1 7.6784  0.1027 0.9381  0.7389\n## u2 0.1027  0.2946 0.1342 -0.2394\n## u3 0.9381  0.1342 0.4943  0.1539\n## u4 0.7389 -0.2394 0.1539  0.7417\n## \n## Summary of Residual AR(1) Serial Correlations\n##    N     Mean   Median      SD      Min     Max\n##   57  -0.1739  -0.2529  0.2912  -0.6048  0.4128\n## \n## Summary of Individual R-Squared's\n##    N    Mean  Median      SD      Min     Max\n##   57  0.5093  0.5816  0.3811  -0.0188  0.9995\nplot(dfm, xlim = c(200, 415))</pre>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></p>\n<pre>plot(dfm, type = \"individual\", method = \"all\")</pre>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>The factor model is, ostensibly, heavily impacted by the COVID shock, although the extent to which this shock introduced error in the model parameters is not clear. For this demonstration at least, I will not modify the data to deal with the shock. Ostensibly, a significant amount of series still display autoregressive dynamics at <code>mean(abs(rho)) = 0.3</code>, with autoregressive parameters <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\rho\\)</span> ranging from -0.6 to 0.41. As further described in the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/dfms/main/vignettes/dynamic_factor_models_paper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">theoretical vignette</a>, the model with autoregressive errors not only estimates these <span class=\"math inline\">\\(\\rho\\)</span> parameters for each series—saved in <code>dfm$rho</code>—but also the error series <span class=\"math inline\">\\(e_t\\)</span> itself—saved in <code>dfm$e</code>—which are modeled as part of the state vector along with the factors. This implies that for these models one can make predictions using either the full state including the modeled residual values or using just the factors. The difference, in this case, is vast, with modeled residuals giving a much better fit to the data.</p>\n<pre># Computing residual absolute ratio in percentage terms\nrarp &lt;- fmedian(abs(resid(dfm))) / fmedian(abs(resid(dfm, use.full.state = FALSE))) * 100\ndescr(rarp)\n## Dataset: rarp, 1 Variables, N = 57\n## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n## rarp (numeric): \n## Statistics\n##    N  Ndist  Mean    SD   Min  Max  Skew  Kurt\n##   57     57  0.04  0.06  0.01  0.3  2.41  8.89\n## Quantiles\n##     1%    5%   10%   25%   50%   75%   90%   95%   99%\n##   0.01  0.01  0.01  0.01  0.02  0.05  0.13  0.16  0.27\n## ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>\n<p>While using the full state (the new default) changes the interpretation of in-sample residuals and fitted values, it generally slightly improves the accuracy of dynamic predictions obtainable with <code>predict()</code>.</p>\n<pre>plot(predict(dfm), xlim = c(400, 428), ylim = c(-2, 2))</pre>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-lazy-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://www.r-bloggers.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/lazy-images/images/1x1.trans.gif\"/><noscript><img alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sebkrantz.github.io/Rblog/2026/01/29/releasing-dfms-1-0-fast-and-feature-rich-estimation-of-dynamic-factor-models-in-r/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png?w=450&amp;ssl=1\"/></noscript></p>\n<p>Now, the main addition in <em>dfms</em> 1.0, as mentioned, is the news decomposition via <code>news()</code>.

Nevertheless, the package now provides a full, efficient, and user-friendly implementation of the Banbura and Modugno (2014) methodology in R—which remains the baseline as far as linear Gaussian factor and nowcasting models are concerned. I thus hope that it will be useful to researchers and practitioners interested in DFMs and nowcasting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section level2\" id=\"references\">\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Doz, C., Giannone, D., &amp; Reichlin, L.
