Today, it’s an expectation.\nThanks to better training, analytics, and even changes in ball composition, home runs have skyrocketed — literally.\nLet’s explore\nhow home runs per game have changed in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1901 to today\n, and what that means for the modern game (and even for betting markets\n).\nThe Data Story\nWe’ll use the\nLahman Baseball Database\n— one of the most complete historical baseball datasets — to calculate the number of\nhome runs per game\nin each MLB season since 1901.\nHere’s the R code to reproduce the visualization:\n— 1) Packages —\npackages <- c(“tidyverse”, “Lahman”, “scales”, “gganimate”, “gifski”)\nto_install <- packages[!packages %in% installed.packages()[, “Package”]]\nif (length(to_install)) install.packages(to_install, dependencies = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Lahman)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(gifski)\n— 2) Build season-level metrics (HR per game) —\nTeams table: HR (team home runs), G (team games).

Pitchers dominated, and balls were softer.\n1920s–1950s:\nEnter Babe Ruth and the power era. The home run became a weapon.\n1990s–2000s (Steroid Era):\nPower surged to record highs, crossing 1 HR/game.\n2010s–Today:\nThe “launch-angle revolution” and optimized hitting made power the new normal.\nBy 2019, MLB reached an all-time peak:\n1.39 home runs per game\n— more than\nsix times\nthe rate seen in 1910.\nBetting Implications\nFor sports bettors and modelers, this trend matters:\nTotals (Over/Under):\nBooks have adjusted — games with more power see higher totals, often 9.0+ runs.\nPlayer props:\nHR lines, slugging props, and “home run to be hit” markets depend heavily on current HR environment.\nPark factors:\nSmall stadiums (like Yankee Stadium or Great American Ball Park) amplify power numbers even more.\nUnderstanding historical context helps avoid recency bias — home run rates\nfluctuate\n, and when the ball or strike zone changes, markets often lag behind.\nThe Big Picture\nThe home run boom has changed baseball strategy.\nIt’s more entertaining — but also more polarized: strikeouts are up, singles are down, and the game has tilted toward “three true outcomes.”\nWhether you love or hate it,\npower has become baseball’s defining feature\n.\nConclusion\nHome runs tell a story not just about players, but about technology, physics, and data.\nFrom Babe Ruth to Aaron Judge, baseball’s obsession with power reflects how analytics and innovation reshape the game we love.\nAnd for those who bet on baseball?\nKnowing the\nrhythm of power\nmight just be your edge.\nThe post\nThe Home Run Boom in Baseball — Visualized with R\nappeared first on\nR Programming Books\n.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nBlog - R Programming Books\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
