(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nStreamlining Our Pharmaverse Blog: Reducing Publishing Time with containers\nAs an active contributor to the pharmaverse blog, I’ve always appreciated the opportunity to share new insights and tools with our community. The pharmaverse blog has some interesting features for publishing. While the blog publishing process has been effective, I was wondering if there was a way to optimize our workflows. Currently, the CI/CD pipeline for publishing the blog typically took about 17 minutes to deploy a new post. Containers are always batted around as solutions. Unfortunately, I was unsure how to create a new container/image to meet my needs and relied on some straight\ninstall.packages()\nin the CI/CD pipeline. Luckily, I crossed paths with the fabulous Maciej Nasinski and we built a specific container for the publishing process for the pharmaverse blog, which allowed for a notable reduction in publishing time.\nBelow I will discuss how the pharmaverse container image has improved our blog’s publishing workflow, bringing our deployment time down to approximately 5 minutes. We are also interested in feedback on potential other uses of this container (like devcontainers) or building additional containers for certain purposes. For those interested, we would be happy to provide a tutorial on containers or get in touch if you have ideas or want to get involved!\nThe Previous Approach:\nPackage Installation overhead\nOur prior CI/CD (GitHub Actions) workflow for building and deploying the pharmaverse blog, while comprehensive, included a time-consuming step. It used the a straight “Install dependencies” step from the r-lib actions, which necessitated installing a range of pharmaverse specific R packages during each run. As we added more packages to the pharmaverse to the blog, this became really cumbersome!\nThe relevant section of our old build-deploy job highlighted this:\nbuild-deploy:\n    # ... other configurations ...\n    steps:\n      # ... checkout and setup Quarto ...\n      - name: Setup R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          use-public-rspm: true\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n        with:\n          packages: |\n            jsonlite\n            tidyverse\n            spelling\n            janitor\n            diffdf\n            admiral\n            admiralonco\n            # ... and many, many more packages ...\n            haven\n      # ... other steps like install tinytex and publish ...\nThis “Install dependencies” step, involving a substantial list of pharmaverse packages, was a primary contributor to the 17-minute execution time. Each workflow run involved downloading and configuring these packages, extending the overall deployment duration.\nAdopting the pharmaverse container image: An Efficient Alternative\nThe solution to this challenge came with the introduction of the pharmaverse container image:\nghcr.io/pharmaverse/docker_pharmaverse:4.5.1\n. This container image was specifically designed for pharmaceutical data analysis, featuring over 40 essential pharmaverse packages pre-installed. These packages cover various functionalities, including CDISC ADaM/SDTM, clinical trial reporting, and regulatory submissions. Built upon the rocker/tidyverse image and incorporating R 4.5.1, it provides a pre-configured environment.\nBy integrating this image into our CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions), we could bypass the extensive package installation phase.\nHere’s an overview of our updated build-deploy job:\nbuild-deploy:\n    needs: Update-post-dates\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    container:\n      image: \"ghcr.io/pharmaverse/docker_pharmaverse:4.5.1\"\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Configure Git safe directory\n        run: git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/blog/blog\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with:\n            version: 1.9.12\n\n      # NOTE: Explicit R package installation is no longer required here.\n\n      - name: Install tinytex\n        run: quarto install tool tinytex\n\n      - name: Mark repo directory as safe\n        run: git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/blog/blog\n\n      - name: Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          path: . # Path to your .qmd file\n          target: gh-pages  # Target branch for GitHub Pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nThe outcome of this change has been a consistent reduction in publishing time. Our blog now publishes in approximately 5 minutes. Yay!\nWider Applications of the Pharmaverse Container Image\nWhile this update directly benefits our blog’s publishing, the pharmaverse container image offers broader utility. It is a valuable resource for:\nPharmaceutical data analysis: Supporting tasks related to ADaM, SDTM, and TLFs.\nClinical trial programming: Assisting with regulatory submissions.\nReproducible research: Providing a consistent and verifiable environment.\nTraining & education: Offering a ready-to-use setup for educational purposes.\nCI/CD pipelines: Enhancing automated testing and reporting, as observed in our own workflow.\nCollaborative development: Facilitating consistent environments across teams.\nExample: Running Reproducible RStudio Locally\nTo spin up a local RStudio instance using the pharmaverse image, you can use a container “one-liner.” This command condenses the entire configuration – networking, storage, and background execution – into a single execution string. It bridges your local folder to the container, allowing you to edit files “on the fly” without installing R or packages on your actual machine.\nChoose the command that matches your operating system:\n1. Linux & Intel Macs (Standard)\nFor standard architecture, we set a simple password (\nrstudio\n) and mount the current directory.\ndocker run -d --name my_pharma_rstudio --rm -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=rstudio -v \"$(pwd)\":/home/rstudio/project ghcr.io/pharmaverse/docker_pharmaverse:4.5.1\n2. Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)\nNote:\nWe do not yet natively support ARM64 architecture (e.g., Apple Silicon). The command below uses emulation (\n--platform linux/amd64\n) to run the image. We also disable authentication because the slower emulation speed can sometimes cause password setup to time out.\ndocker run -d --name my_pharma_rstudio --rm --platform linux/amd64 -p 8787:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=true -v \"$(pwd)\":/home/rstudio/project ghcr.io/pharmaverse/docker_pharmaverse:4.5.1\nWhat does this command do?\n**\n--rm\n&\n-d**\n: Runs the container in the background (detached) and automatically removes it when stopped, keeping your machine clean.\n-v \"$(pwd)\":...\n: Takes your\nP\nresent\nW\norking\nD\nirectory and mounts it inside the container. Any file you save in RStudio’s “project” folder is instantly saved to your local computer.\n--platform linux/amd64\n(Mac only)\n: Forces your computer to emulate the Intel architecture required by the image.\n-e DISABLE_AUTH=true\n(Mac only)\n: Bypasses the login screen to ensure immediate access despite slower emulation speeds.\nAccessing RStudio\nOnce the command is running:\nOpen your browser to\nhttp://localhost:8787\n.\nLinux/Intel:\nLog in with user\nrstudio\nand password\nrstudio\n.\nApple Silicon:\nYou will be logged in automatically.\nYou will see your local files mapped to the\nproject\nfolder in the Files pane, ready for analysis.\nEngaging with the Pharmaverse Community\nThe pharmaverse container image mage represents a collaborative effort within the life sciences industry to provide open-source tools. For those working with pharmaverse packages and R in development, research, or CI/CD contexts, exploring this image may offer practical advantages in efficiency and reproducibility.\nExplore the pharmaverse container image repository:\npharmaverse/docker_pharmaverse\nDiscover more about Pharmaverse:\npharmaverse.org\nWe acknowledge the contributions of the pharmaverse community and the Rocker Project for their support in developing these resources.\nLast updated\n2026-01-18 22:21:19.079894\nDetails\nSource\n,\nSession info\nReuse\nCC BY 4.0\nCitation\nBibTeX citation:\n@online{straub_and_maciej_nasinski2026,\n  author = {Straub and Maciej Nasinski, Ben},\n  title = {Pharmaverse and {Containers}},\n  date = {2026-01-18},\n  url = {https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2026-01-18_pharmaverse_containers/pharmaverse_and__containers.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nStraub and Maciej Nasinski, Ben. 2026.\n“Pharmaverse and\nContainers.”\nJanuary 18, 2026.\nhttps://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2026-01-18_pharmaverse_containers/pharmaverse_and__containers.html\n.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\npharmaverse blog\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
