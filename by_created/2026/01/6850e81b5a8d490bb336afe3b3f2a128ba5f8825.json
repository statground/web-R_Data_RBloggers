For an ecology specific\nargument see here\n.\nTeaching coding is teaching people how to think logically and structure problems. These skills are essential not only in coding, but also for good science and problem solving in general.\nSo you need to learn to code to learn to think logically and structure problems.\nA more practical standpoint is that LLMs are good at generating code that they have seen a lot of examples of in their data. But they are not so good at creative work on novel topics or niche areas.\nFor example, AI coding assistants struggle to make a simple\ntmap\n(the R mapping package) work well.\ntmap\nwas updated recently, meaning the examples in the LLM’s training are out of date.\nThe coding assistants also seem to default to code patterns they are most familiar with, like\nggplot2\nsyntax. Not all of this works with\ntmap\n.\nIn general, I find they perform much better at statistical modelling in R than they do with complex geospatial analyses.\nThis practical issue may increasingly become less relevant as LLMs get better and we create better resources to inform their actions (like a tmap specific guide for LLMs to read before advising you, or web searches of the tmap page).\nBut it is still likely that frontier modelling will require deep human engagement with code. So learning to code is important for researchers.\nI’ll leave the final say to Andrej Karpathy, former head of AI at Tesla and founding member of OpenAI’s research group.\nIn a\nrecent podcast interview\nhe talks about a repo he made to help teach people how to work with LLMs. His advice to learners is literally to re-write his repo by hand, not even to cut and paste.\nHe goes on to explain that AI agents are good for very standard code or code that is common on the internet. But they perform poorly for creating new code, or code that contradicts common patterns.\nFor any research code he most commonly uses the code auto-complete features that AI assistants have, rather than AI agents.\nHe suggests that to really learn something you should code it yourself, using examples only as references.\nKarpathy came up with the term ‘vibe-coding’ which means creating code by prompting, without reviewing the code. Usually an AI agent is used. So its saying a lot if he thinks that learning means doing it the old fashioned way of writing code yourself.\nRelated\nTo\nleave a comment\nfor the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog:\nSeascapemodels\n.\nR-bloggers.com\noffers\ndaily e-mail updates\nabout\nR\nnews and tutorials about\nlearning R\nand many other topics.\nClick here if you're looking to post or find an R/data-science job\n.\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.",
