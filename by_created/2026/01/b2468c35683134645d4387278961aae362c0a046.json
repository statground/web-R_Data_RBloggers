(You can report issue about the content on this page\nhere\n)\nWant to share your content on R-bloggers?\nclick here\nif you have a blog, or\nhere\nif you don't.\nWelcome to omicslog!\nI still remember being in front of my PI, trying to recall, or even worse, to guess the number of samples we had ignored when running a specific analysis, such as filtering low-count genes for DEG analysis or excluding biological samples collected outside a target time window when we aimed to discover biomarker candidates for early disease detection. I especially remember how that became even worse across the different projects we were working on simultaneously.\nThe solution was always the same: rerun the whole code up to the line that could answer those questions. That was even more frustrating considering that, in many cases, those questions came from pure curiosity rather than information that would be included in the final publication.\nInspired by the\nlab notebook\nfrom my wet lab colleagues and the\ntidylog\npackage, we present\nomicslog\n, a package that provides logging capabilities for omics-oriented objects. Our goal is to establish a standard for tracking changes to these objects, acting as an automated dry lab notebook and improving the reproducibility of specific analyses.\nWe started by enabling logging for the\nSummarizedExperiment\nclass, powered by\ntidyomics\nfunctionalities. Every function in the pipeline is evaluated, with changes traced and aggregated as metadata.\nLet’s start with a practical example, beginning with the package installation and library loading:\nif (!require(\"devtools\", quietly = TRUE))\n    install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"tidyomics/omicslog\")\n\nlibrary(SummarizedExperiment)\nlibrary(tidySummarizedExperiment)\nlibrary(omicslog)\nFor this example, we worked with the\nairway\ndataset. To extend\ntidyomics\nwith\nomicslog\n, it is only necessary to add the\nlog_start()\nfunction before applying the different filtering criteria:\ndata(airway, package = \"airway\")\n\nresult <- \n  airway |>\n  log_start() |> # Starting the logging operations\n  filter(dex == \"trt\") |>\n  select(!albut) |>\n  mutate(dex_upper = toupper(dex)) |>\n  extract(col = dex, into = \"treat\") |>\n  mutate(Run = tolower(Run)) |> \n  filter(.feature == \"ENSG00000000003\") |>\n  slice(3)\n\nresult\n#> # A SummarizedExperiment-tibble abstraction: 1 × 1\n#> # Features=1 | Samples=1 | Assays=counts\n#>   .feature      .sample counts SampleName cell  treat Run   avgLength Experiment\n#>   <chr>         <chr>    <int> <fct>      <fct> <chr> <chr>     <int> <fct>     \n#> 1 ENSG00000000… SRR103…   1047 GSM1275871 N080… trt   srr1…       126 SRX384354 \n#> # ℹ 3 more variables: Sample <fct>, BioSample <fct>, dex_upper <chr>\n#> \n#> Operation log:\n#> [2025-12-17 13:21:30] filter: removed 4 samples (50%), 4 samples remaining\n#> [2025-12-17 13:21:31] select: removed 1 (11%), 8 column(s) remaining\n#> [2025-12-17 13:21:31] mutate: added 1 new column(s): dex_upper\n#> [2025-12-17 13:21:31] extract: extracted 'dex' into column: treat (original removed)\n#> [2025-12-17 13:21:31] mutate: modified column(s): Run\n#> [2025-12-17 13:21:31] filter: removed 64101 genes (100%), 1 genes remaining\n#> [2025-12-17 13:21:31] slice: Kept 1/4 rows (25.0%); removed 3 rows\nAs a result, the\nmetadata\nshows a short description of the different modifications the\nSummarizedExperiment\nunderwent during each function in the pipeline, formatted as\n[TIME] FUNCTION NAME: ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION\n.\nNotwithstanding,\nomicslog\ncan also work with base R commands by simply adding the dataset name to the\nlog_start()\nfunction:\noptions(restore_SummarizedExperiment_show = TRUE)\n\nresult_base <- log_start(airway) # Starting the logging operations\n\nresult_base <- result_base[, colData(result_base)$dex == \"trt\"]\ncolData(result_base)$dex_upper <- toupper(colData(result_base)$dex)\ncolData(result_base)$Run <- tolower(colData(result_base)$Run)\nresult_base <- result_base[rownames(result_base) == \"ENSG00000000003\", ]\n\nresult_base\n#> class: SummarizedExperimentLogged \n#> dim: 1 4 \n#> metadata(1): ''\n#> assays(1): counts\n#> rownames(1): ENSG00000000003\n#> rowData names(0):\n#> colnames(4): SRR1039509 SRR1039513 SRR1039517 SRR1039521\n#> colData names(10): SampleName cell ...

In essence, for every function you apply to a\nSummarizedExperiment\nobject, it tracks changes in rows and columns and records a message describing those changes in a dedicated logging structure stored in the object’s\nmetadata\n.\nLet us suppose we want to filter the\nairway\ndataset to retain only samples treated with dexamethasone (\ndex == \"trt\"\n):\nresult1 <- airway |> filter(dex == \"untrt\")\nHow many samples did we keep? Let us find out:\nremaining_samples <- length(colData(result1)$Sample)\nremaining_samples\n#> [1] 4\nWhat about the removed data? How many samples were discarded?\nsamples_removed <- length(colData(airway)$Sample) - length(colData(result1)$Sample)\nsamples_removed\n#> [1] 4\nIt is often useful to express this change as a percentage, since we may be discarding a substantial amount of information:\npercentage <- round(100 - samples_removed / length(colData(airway)$Sample) * 100,2)\npercentage\n#> [1] 50\nAt this point, we have a clear idea of how much the dataset has been modified. However, in practice, we often need to retrieve this kind of information repeatedly. To avoid manual bookkeeping, we would like to store it directly in the object itself, using the\nmetadata\nslot.\nBefore doing so, we need some additional context, such as\nwhen\nthe operation was executed and\nwhich\nfunction was used:\ntime <- Sys.time()\nfunc <- \"filter\"\nThe most straightforward way to persist this information is to create a concise log message:\nresult1@metadata$log_history <- paste(time, func,\": removed\", samples_removed, \"samples\", \"(\", percentage,\"%)\", remaining_samples, \"samples remaining\")\nresult1@metadata$log_history\n#> [1] \"2025-12-17 13:27:34 filter : removed 4 samples ( 50 %) 4 samples remaining\"\nColumn-related operations follow the same logic. For example, let us remove the\nalbut\ncolumn, as we are not interested in samples treated with albuterol:\nresult2 <- result1 |>\n  select(!albut)\nEven though we know that exactly one column was removed, it is still valuable to keep track of\nhow\nthe dataset was modified,\nwhen\nthe change occurred, and\nwhich\nfunction was responsible:\ncolumns_removed <- ncol(colData(result1)) - ncol(colData(result2))\ncolumns_remaining <- ncol(colData(result2))\npercentage <- 100 - round(ncol(colData(result2)) / ncol(colData(result1)) * 100,2)\ntime <- Sys.time()\nfunc <- \"select\"\n\nresult1@metadata$log_history <- c(result1@metadata$log_history,\npaste(time, func,\": removed\", columns_removed, \"(\", percentage,\"%)\", columns_remaining, \"column(s) remaining\")\n)\nresult1@metadata$log_history\n#> [1] \"2025-12-17 13:27:34 filter : removed 4 samples ( 50 %) 4 samples remaining\"\n#> [2] \"2025-12-17 13:28:38 select : removed 1 ( 11.11 %) 8 column(s) remaining\"\nAs shown above, we extract the same type of information and append a new log entry to the\nmetadata\nslot, just as we did for the row-based operation.\nToo much work for a single data transformation? We agree. This is exactly where\nomicslog\ncomes in—handling all logging operations automatically, so you can focus on the analysis.\nWe need your feedback!\nBesides the messages shown above, what other operation details might you be interested in logging for an omics-oriented project?\nDon’t hesitate to open an issue in the\nomicslog\nGitHub repo.\n© 2025 tidyomics.
